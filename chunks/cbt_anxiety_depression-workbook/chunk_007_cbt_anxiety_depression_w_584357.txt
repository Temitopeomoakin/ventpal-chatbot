Depression
What is depression?
Feeling fed up and low in mood is a normal part of life. This is especially true when it’s in response to an upsetting or difficult event or situation.
Usually, the reasons for us feeling low in mood are clear (e.g. a stressful situation, a relationship difficulty such as feeling let down by someone, or a practical problem) and the drop in our mood only lasts for a short period of time.
Occasionally a person’s mood may seem to drop for little or no obvious reason, and it may be difficult to know why initially. In some cases, depression can worsen and completely dominate the person’s life. When someone feels very low for more than two weeks, day after day, week after week, this is called a depressive illness. When depression occurs like this, it affects the person’s mood and thinking. It can also lead to altered behaviour and cause a range of physical symptoms in their body.
