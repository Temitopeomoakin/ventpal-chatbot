Introducing CBT
How can Cognitive Behavioural
Therapy (CBT) help?
Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is one form of psychological treatment that focuses on the ‘here and now’.
Sometimes, when we feel low or anxious, we’re more likely to see things in a negative way and our thoughts can become unhelpful.
Similarly, our behaviour can change and the things we do,
or don’t do, also become unhelpful or negative.
We can’t directly change how we feel emotionally or physically, but by identifying, challenging and changing our unhelpful thoughts and behaviours, we can make changes indirectly.
Often, it is our response to a certain trigger or situation that causes us to feel the way we do.
It’s not the trigger or situation itself that causes us to feel low or anxious, it’s the way we interpret the situation or act because of it.
The ways we think and act are often our way of coping with the trigger or situation.
Although they can be helpful in the short-term, these coping mechanisms can end up being unhelpful in the long-term, especially if left unchanged.
