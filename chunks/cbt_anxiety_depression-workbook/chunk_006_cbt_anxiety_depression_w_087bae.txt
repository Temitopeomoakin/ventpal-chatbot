Why do we feel anxious?
Imagine this scenario: Caveman v Tiger
A caveman is out hunting for his dinner when he is faced by a hungry tiger.
What does he need to do in order to survive? He needs to either fight the tiger off or run away.
In order to fight or flee, the body must prepare itself in a number of ways:
• The brain sends messages to the body to pump adrenaline into the bloodstream and large skeletal muscles of the arms and legs.
• The heart then pumps faster and needs more oxygen so our breathing rate increases.
• The body needs to cool down so it may sweat, causing clamminess or capillaries come to the surface of the skin, resulting in blushing.
• To be as light as possible, there may be a need for the bowels to empty or frequent urination to occur.
In our modern, daily lives, it is very unlikely that we will be faced with hungry tigers – but we are still exposed to real or imagined threats or stressors,
and our bodies respond to these in the same way.
If the situation is not physically threatening (e.g. giving a presentation) this response is not helpful for coping with the situation, and can actually be quite frightening.
