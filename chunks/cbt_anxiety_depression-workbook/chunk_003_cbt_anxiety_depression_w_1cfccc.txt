Hot cross bun
The way you think about a problem (thoughts), can affect how your body reacts (physically) and emotionally (feelings). It can also alter how you might act in response to that trigger (behaviour).
A simple way of showing this process is in the ‘hot cross bun’ diagram below, which gets its name due to the cross in the middle and the round shape.
