Questionnaires
What are the questionnaires?
As part of your treatment, you will be asked to complete the questionnaires for each session. You may recognise these from your initial assessment appointment. These look at the common symptoms of anxiety, depression, phobias and the impact of these.
You may also receive additional questionnaires if there is one also relevant to your current difficulties. We do not use these to diagnose you with any mental health condition, but to help measure how you are feeling and whether there are any symptoms we should be aware of in treatment to be able to give you the best support we can.
How do I complete the questionnaires?
These are usually emailed to you to complete before the appointment if you have allowed web forms to be sent to you. It is helpful to complete these before each session.
