Depression
What could maintain the depression cycle?
Reduced activity
Reduced activity is often experienced when a person is feeling depressed. Their activity levels may reduce due to a lack of energy,
low motivation, and the fact it takes a lot more effort to do things.
Reduced activity can mean we struggle to keep on top of routine activities, such as household chores, necessary activities like paying bills or sorting out an important problem, and pleasurable activities such as seeing friends and engaging in hobbies.
By not engaging in these activities anymore, we lose the opportunity to experience a sense of pleasure, enjoyment and achievement that doing these activities normally gives us. Although avoiding activities gives us a short-term sense of relief, it impacts on our mood in the long-term by feeding into and maintaining it. The less we do, the lower we feel, the lower we feel, the less we do. It’s a vicious cycle.
Rumination
Rumination is when you have constant and repetitive thoughts about something.
Sometimes we can find ourselves going over and over things in our mind that have happened in the past, or decisions we have made that have led to our current situation.
This can feed into our low mood, cause us to struggle to engage in activities and be present in the moment, and lead to other negative thinking traps.
The more negative thoughts we have, the lower we feel and the lower we feel, the more negative thoughts we have. It’s another vicious cycle.
