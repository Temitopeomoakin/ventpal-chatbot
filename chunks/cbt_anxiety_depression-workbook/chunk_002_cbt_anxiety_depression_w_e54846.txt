Introducing CBT
What is treatment like?
CBT is different from other therapies in that it relies on the person engaging with it to complete tasks outside of the sessions in order to learn the skills and techniques required to make changes to how they think, feel and behave.
These skills and techniques give us a toolkit for use now, and in the future, the next time life gets difficult.
How do I get started?
Step 1
Identify the trigger or triggers (for examples see pages 6 and 7).
Step 2
Identify your symptoms under the following areas:
• Thoughts
• Feelings
• Physical
• Behaviour
Each of these different areas often affects the others.
Step 3
Use techniques learnt throughout your sessions with your therapist to help break these cycles.
If you have any questions about how CBT works, please speak to your therapist.
