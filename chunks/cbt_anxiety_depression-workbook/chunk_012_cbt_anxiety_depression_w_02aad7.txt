Goal setting
What are your treatment goals?
When planning your treatment goals, it is important to make sure they are SMART.
• Specific – What, when, where, with who?
• Measurable – How will you know you have completed this activity?
• Achievable – Do you have everything you need to achieve this?
• Realistic – Is it realistic?
• Time-focused – What time, what day, for how long?
Example:
“Do exercise” becomes “To go swimming every Friday at 9am for 30 minutes, by myself”
