Anxiety
What is anxiety?
Anxiety is a normal and natural response to situations that we perceive as threatening.
Everyone experiences anxiety, although the level of anxiety and the situations in which it presents itself can differ from person to person. For example, some people are terrified of speaking in front of a large audience, whereas other people are happy to do this.
Example:
Going to a crowded place
Thoughts
What if I get anxious?
Physical
Feelings
Sweaty, hot,
Anxious, worried shortness of breath
Behaviours
Leave the situation,
donâ€™t go to the event
What could maintain the anxiety cycle?
Avoidance
Gives us short-term relief, but in the long term reinforces our sense of not being able to cope as we do not learn that we would have been ok (safe) in the situation.
Misinterpretation
By not understanding the physical symptoms can lead us to think something else is happening (e.g. heart attack, physical illness etc.)
