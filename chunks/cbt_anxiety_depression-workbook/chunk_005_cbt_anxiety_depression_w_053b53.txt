Why do we feel anxious?
Fight or flight
Anxiety serves a very important function – to protect us from danger.
When we are faced with a threat our bodies produce a surge of adrenaline to prepare us to take action. This is commonly referred to as ‘fight or flight’.
When does fight or flight become a problem?
Anxiety becomes a problem when it starts to interfere with our ability to function in daily life. This can happen when we begin to perceive neutral, safe situations as threatening.
People who suffer from anxiety tend to overestimate the threat in certain situations, and at the same time underestimate their ability to cope with that threat.
This leads to the person feeling overwhelmed or out of their depth.
