What if it isn’t working?
Is it the right thought?
If you’re struggling to find the hot thought, make sure:
• Your hot thought is specific and relates to the mood you want to change.
Is it balanced?
If you’re struggling with writing a balanced thought:
• Look at both evidence columns and think about the evidence you have in front of you;
• Try to sum up the evidence in one statement. The statement should include evidence from both columns;
• Think about your hot thought. If it is true, then what is the worst that can happen? How much does it really matter if it is true?
• Remember this is not just about positive thinking. It’s about realistic and balanced thinking. It is important that you believe in your alternative thought.
It could be more helpful to focus on finding solutions to current problems, ask your therapist for our problem solving guide.
