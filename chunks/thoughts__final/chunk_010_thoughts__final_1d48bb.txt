Cognitive restructuring
Step 2 - Identify the “hot thought”
Now we have recorded our thoughts, the next step is to identify which of these is causing the most distress.
We call this the “hot thought” and it is often the thought that is having the most impact on your mood. It is not always the thought that you believe the most but is more the thought that is causing the greatest emotional response in you. Once you have recognised it,
circle it on your thought challenger worksheet.
If we use the same example as in Step 1, the first three columns may now look like this:
Negative thinking style

Mood
Situation thoughts/predictions

“I’m going to be fired” (60%) Low (80%)

“This is all my fault” (80%) Anxious (60%)
targets at work
“Everyone will think I’m an idiot” (90%) Frustrated (50%)
“I am no good at my job” (100%)
