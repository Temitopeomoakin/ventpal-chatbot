Cognitive restructuring
Step 4 – Find a more balanced thought
As you can see from finding both evidence for and against, we are not trying to ignore the negative or the evidence we have for our thoughts;
ignoring the areas that could be improved or are especially difficult can be just as unhelpful as ignoring the positive. We are looking for a balanced view, allowing us to see both sides.
The final two columns look at using the evidence to find a more balanced thought. Once we have done this, we can rate our mood again and see if anything has changed.
If we use the same example, these columns could look like this:
Negative thinking style
Balanced thought
Definition Mood (0-100%)
(Belief 0-100%)
“I didn’t meet my target but that doesn’t mean I’m a failure. I have met targets in the past when a lot of
Low 30%
people haven’t met the targets. My boss told me I am doing a good job.”
Now fill in these last columns on your thought challenger worksheet.
It can be helpful to now rate your belief in your “hot thought”
again and see if that belief has changed.
