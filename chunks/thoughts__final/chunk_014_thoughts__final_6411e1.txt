What if it isn’t working?
Changing how we feel is a slow process but is something that can be helpful if we put in our time and effort. The below tips may be helpful if you’re struggling with thought challenging.
I can’t find enough evidence
If you’re struggling to find evidence to support the hot thought, try to:
• Stick to factual information rather than further negative automatic thoughts or assumptions;
• Think about the experiences you have had that back up this thought.
If you’re struggling to find evidence against the hot thought,
try to:
• Imagine it is your best friend who is having this thought.
What might you say to them?
• Think about what your best friend would say to you if they knew you were having this thought;
• Think about any experiences you have had that contradict this thought;
• Think about times in the past when you have been in this situation and what happened;
• Imagine you are in a good mood – how would you think about this situation?
• Look at the common unhelpful thinking styles on page
