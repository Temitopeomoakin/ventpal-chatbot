Cognitive restructuring
Step 3 – Find evidence for and against
The next step is to identify which of these thoughts is causing the most distress.
The next two columns on the thought challenger worksheet start to look at finding evidence for and against the “hot thought”. We call this “taking your thought to court”
because we need to find the factual evidence for and against this thought, challenging it in the way you would in a court room.
The same as in a courtroom, opinions are not valid evidence. For example: “because I feel like a failure” wouldn’t stand up in court.
We have already seen how many common negative thinking styles there are on and we know that our thoughts aren't always reliable.
If we use the same example with the hot thought “I’m a failure” these columns could look like this:
Negative thinking style
DefinitionEvidence that doesn’t
Evidence that supports that support that thought thought (for)
(against)
1. I didn’t meet my target 1. I have met my targets most of the time
2. I haven’t met my target before 2. Quite often people don’t meet the targets
3. I meet targets more than other people
4. My boss told me I do a good job
Now fill in these columns on your thought challenger worksheet.
Only expert opinions count just as they would in court. So,
in this example your boss could be considered an expert on your work but a family member probably wouldn’t be.
