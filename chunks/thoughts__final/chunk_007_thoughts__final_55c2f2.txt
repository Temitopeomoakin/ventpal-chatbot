Cognitive restructuring
Step 1 – Record your thoughts
The first step is to write down the thoughts that we have. You can use the thought diary on the next page.
Here is an example of recording your thoughts. You can see that the first column recognises the trigger or situation you are in. The second column is where you then list the thoughts that went through your mind in that example. The third column is where you note down what you were feeling and rate your emotion in terms of how strong it was at the time, as a percentage (0-100%).
Automatic
Mood
Situation thoughts/predictions
(0-100%)
(Belief 0-100%)
“I’m a failure” (80%)
“I’m going to be fired” (60%) Low (80%)
I haven’t met my
“This is all my fault” (80%) Anxious (60%)
targets at work
“Everyone will think I’m an idiot” (90%) Frustrated (50%)
“I am no good at my job” (100%)
You may want to think about a few recent situations you have been in and use the thought diary to record your thoughts. Choose one of the situations you recorded in your thought diary and start to complete the worksheet on page 11.
