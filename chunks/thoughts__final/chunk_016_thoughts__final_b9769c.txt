Three helpful techniques
Here are three more techniques which you might find helpful to try for challenging your unhelpful thoughts.
1. Thought stopping
This is a simple technique which can be quite helpful. Like when we discussed using the common thinking styles to label the thoughts when we notice them; people can also find it helpful to shout “STOP” either out loud (if appropriate) or in their head.
This can sometimes help with stopping the thought process from continuing and gives you a moment to question or check in with yourself.
2. Cost benefit analysis
This is something we can use when we find it difficult to challenge our thoughts because we think that they are beneficial to us in some way.
A way of looking at the evidence of this is to weigh the benefits against the costs and see whether these thoughts are more of a benefit or a cost.
For example, the below could show the costs and benefits of the thought “People aren’t going to want to spend time with me if I am myself”.
Benefits % Costs %
