What affects our thinking?
We can sometimes find ourselves stuck in a vicious cycle with our thoughts when we are feeling overwhelmed. When we don’t feel this way, usually we can see things in a more factual and balanced way.
What is a thought?
A thought is not a fact. Our thoughts are often influenced by a number of factors such as mood and experiences. We often have negative automatic thoughts (NATs) that pop into our head in a situation. NATs are driven by how we feel, not always by evidence.
How can anxiety affect our thoughts?
When we feel anxious we tend to make negative and often catastrophic predictions about what will happen to ourselves or others. The cycle on page 4 shows an example of how this can impact our emotions, body and actions. This cycle often causes our anxiety to worsen.
Reflect
Can you think of an example of a time when you noticed this cycle? What were you thinking in that situation?
