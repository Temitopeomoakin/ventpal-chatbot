Cognitive restructuring
How do I start to make changes?
There are many different techniques we use in
Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) but when we want to make changes to our negative thought patterns, we challenge these thoughts using cognitive restructuring.
Identifying your thoughts can be difficult to begin with, but once we have started to increase our awareness of the thoughts we have and how they impact us, we are then able to begin challenging them.
Cognitive restructuring is a process involving five steps to help us work towards more balanced thinking.
Step 1 – Record your thoughts
Step 2 – Identify the “hot thought”
Step 3 – Find evidence for and against
Step 4 – Find a more balanced thought
Step 5 – Review and continue
We will work through the five steps within the next pages.
Even if we don’t usually find it helpful to write things down,
this can be a form of avoidance. We cannot tackle thoughts without clearly seeing what they are first. Try and write them down at least once and see how it goes.
