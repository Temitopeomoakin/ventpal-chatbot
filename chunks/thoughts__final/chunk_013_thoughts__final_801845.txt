Step 5 – Review and continue
Once you have found your balanced thought, see how much impact it has on your mood at the time.
The expectation is not to reach a “0%” rating on our mood but to reduce the impact that the thought has. If you didn’t notice a change in your mood, the next section has some advice which you may find helpful. Then try reviewing the process and try again.
