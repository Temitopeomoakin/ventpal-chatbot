How can low mood affect our thoughts?
When we are looking at making changes to our mood, we tend to start with our motivation as we can sometimes change the low mood cycle by starting with increasing activity (see page 6).
If this is something you are interested in, please ask your therapist for our Behaviours and low mood guide.
When we are focusing on the thoughts in the cycle, however,
there is another aspect we may need to consider. This is that we not only find our activity reducing because of NATs, but also our ability to cope with problems or situations that arise. This can then feed back into feelings of hopelessness when we’re not seeing changes, again impacting our mood.
Reflect
• Have you noticed this cycle in yourself?
• Can you recognise any specific thoughts you have as you experience this cycle?
