Four ways to manage distressing feelings
Grounding exercise
Focusing on what is going on for you right now can help you to reset and find calm in moments of distress. Grounding exercises involve reconnecting with your senses and what you are feeling in your body. Try some of these grounding exercises to bring you back to the here and now:
• Take ten slow breaths
Focus your full attention on each breath. Notice how it fills up your lungs as you breathe in. Observe what it feels like as you breathe out. • Splash some cold water on your face
Notice how this feels and how the towel feels as you dry your face. Try to describe these sensations. • Listen and try to name the sounds around you
Start with the closest or the loudest sounds and then gradually move your awareness outwards and into the distance. • Step outside or open a window
Notice the temperature of the air and how it is different or similar to the air inside. What new things can you smell? • Put on a piece of music and take a piece of paper and a pen
Start drawing a line as the music plays, following the music with the pen. Relaxation exercise
When we are experiencing stress, we can easily start feeling overwhelmed,
disconnected and tense. Relaxing your body is a simple way to calm yourself and feel more anchored during stressful periods. Relaxation exercises can be a helpful way to reconnect with yourself, and find a place of calm amidst everything that is going on. Relaxing is easier said than done, particularly if you are often tense or on edge, but you can learn to relax. Relaxation is a skill and, like any skill, it improves with practice. You don’t need to spend hours practicing relaxation; five minutes a day can make a huge difference and significantly lower your stress levels.
