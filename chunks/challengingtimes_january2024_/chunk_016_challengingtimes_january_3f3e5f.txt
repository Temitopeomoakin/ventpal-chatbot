Focusing the mind
Sometimes when you become engrossed in an activity or task that you are passionate about, you can lose all sense of time. You might suddenly realise that hours have passed, when it has felt like mere minutes. This is called flow.
Flow happens when you become totally absorbed in what you are doing and experience intense concentration.
Flow is characterised by an absence of emotion and selfconsciousness, you are so absorbed by the task at hand that you donâ€™t think or feel. In this sense it is similar to meditation.
Flow can be very soothing when dealing with stress, as it gives you a time-out from the strong or overwhelming emotions you might be feeling. After periods of flow, people tend to feel a sense of achievement and satisfaction, which can be welcome positive feelings during times of crisis.
