How you may be feeling…
Whether it is the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns about the cost of living, we are living in challenging times and this is disrupting many aspects of our personal and working lives.
People are facing new challenges that are having an impact on their mental health, including:
• Worries about getting sick
• Caring for loved ones who are sick
• Managing job loss or worrying about work stability
• Financial stress and economic worries
• Struggles with self-isolation
• Stress in families and parenting under pressure
• Balancing working from home while minding children
In this workbook we want to offer some support to people going through these challenges. We also want to equip you with tools to manage stress and anxiety and to cope as resourcefully as possible.
