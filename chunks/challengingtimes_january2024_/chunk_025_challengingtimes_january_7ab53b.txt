Plan some play times
Rather than responding to your childrenâ€™s requests to play throughout the day, try to set aside some fun play times during the day, when you can give them your full attention. This might be doing a craft together, playing a family game in the evening, watching a family TV show or having a video call with a grandparent or relative together. Set one or two interesting goals each week that you can look forward to, whether this is trying a new game, learning something, or doing an online quiz with extended family and friends. 21
