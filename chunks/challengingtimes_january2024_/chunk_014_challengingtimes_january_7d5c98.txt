How to focus on what you can control
Be kind to yourself
When times are tough and we are under stress we often fall into negative patterns of criticising or blaming ourselves. Being actively compassionate towards yourself involves being aware of your needs and knowing when things are getting too much.
See our section on Self-Compassion for more information.
Take action to keep yourself safe
Another thing you do have control over is following the official health guidance for your particular location, e.g. washing your hands regularly and maintaining a safe distance from people outside your home. These actions allow you to maintain your own wellbeing, but they also contribute to the safety of your community. See your local
Health Service or government website for guidelines, or follow those of the World
Health Organisation if in doubt.
Proactively solve problems
Problem solving helps you to define exactly what you are worrying about, and it helps you to work out the best way of dealing with a problem, with a simple step-bystep approach. Problem solving can be an effective way of working through worries about things you do have control over.
