How you may be feeling…
Living through a challenging time or crisis situation can be unsettling and distressing. Suddenly having to adjust, both psychologically and at a practical level, to strange circumstances can put a strain on you and your mental health. This is a normal reaction to exceptional circumstances.
We are creatures of habit and we tend not to like change. Some people can tolerate uncertainty, but most people will feel some anxiety when facing uncertain situations.
This is a normal response to your brain picking up the signals that there is danger out there.
In emergency situations anxiety is there to help you survive as best you can. It is not a sign that you aren’t coping or that you are suffering with a mental health condition.
In these challenging times you might feel a range of strong and unpleasant emotions on a daily basis. You might worry more than usual. You might have to make some drastic changes to how you live your life, almost overnight.
