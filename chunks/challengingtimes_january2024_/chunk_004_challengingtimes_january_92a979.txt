Noticing your negative emotions
Anger
• Anger occurs when we feel that we or the people we care about are being hurt or wronged in some way.
• Anger motivates us to take action to address these wrongdoings and set things right. It can also be associated with destructive behaviours like shouting or aggression. It’s important to separate our possible responses to anger from the emotional message itself.
• In the current situation you might be angry about the pandemic itself and the unfairness of it all. You might also feel angry about the responses of other people or your government towards the situation.
Guilt and shame
• Guilt and shame occur when we feel that we have done something ‘wrong’, i.e.
something which goes against our morals or what we feel is expected of us.
• These emotions prompt us to address the situation and make amends, e.g. by apologising. They also allow us to learn from the experience and move forward.
• For example, in the current situation, you might experience guilt or shame if you sometimes forgot to follow the recommended guidelines around social distancing and later became unwell.
