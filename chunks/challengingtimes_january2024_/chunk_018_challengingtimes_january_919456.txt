Kindness and self-compassion
Compassionate self-talk
Compassionate self-talk is anything supportive, kind, helpful, caring,
encouraging or soothing you say to yourself. Talk to yourself as if you were talking to someone you love dearly.
The goal of compassionate self-talk is to create a less judgemental inner conversation,
one that still describes the same reality, but in a much more compassionate way. For example,
If you feel overwhelmed juggling work and minding your children, instead of saying to yourself “I can’t handle it, I’m a failure”, it is more compassionate to say:
• This is a really tough situation, lots of people are feeling overwhelmed. I’m a good parent and employee. I’m doing my best and its okay if I’m not perfect.
If you make a mistake and forget to wash your hands once, instead of berating yourself with “I am such an idiot, I’m going to get sick now”, it is more compassionate and helpful to say:
• Everyone makes mistakes, I will learn from this and try to make it a routine so I don’t forget next time.
