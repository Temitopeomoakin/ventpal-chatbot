Making time for what matters most
Quadrant 1 - Important and urgent
Quadrant 1 activities are those that are important and have to be done urgently – for example, in the current crisis scenario these types of activities include ensuring you have enough food for your family, that your children are looked after, and attending essential medical appointments, etc.
Quadrant 2 - Important and not urgent
Quadrant 2 activities are important activities that aren’t pressing or urgent - for example,
this may include making sure that, in spite of being pulled in a lot of different directions, you are spending time with family, listening to your partner, finding ways to do some physical exercise, keeping connected to others etc.
Quadrant 3 - Not Important and urgent
Quadrant 3 activities are those that appear urgent but that are not that important to you,
such as chores that you have got into the habit of doing but which are not actually that important.
Quadrant 4 - Not Important and not urgent
Quadrant 4 activities are those time-wasting activities that we all engage in that are neither important nor urgent. Some appear relatively harmless like surfing the net or engaging in idle gossip or chit-chat, or some are more serious or addictive like activities such as overdrinking.
