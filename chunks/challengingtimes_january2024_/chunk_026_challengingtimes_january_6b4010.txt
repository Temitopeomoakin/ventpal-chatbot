Creating a family routine
Relax about homework
Rather than becoming obsessed with ‘home-schooling’ your children, which can lead to increased pressure and battles, it is important to relax about homework. While you might punctuate the day with one or two learning periods when screens are turned off, it is better to set small, achievable learning goals that the children are largely in charge of. Avail of what online school supports might be available, so you don’t have to take on the role of a strict teacher.
Help children plan their activities
Help your children create their own routine and alternate their activities throughout the day.
For example, in a given day they might alternate between screen time by themselves
1. Doing a play activity
2. Reading a book
3. Watching a TV programme with family
4. Playing in garden
5. Playing music
6. Doing a craft
7. Going for family walk etc.
The key is to strike a balance between screens and other activities as well as time alone and time with the family.
Take the pressure off
Being cooped up in the same house already brings a lot of pressure. Reduce your expectations and don’t expect to be a super parent doing everything. Have a gentle start to your day, set one or two goals, let your children watch a bit more TV, and focus on enjoyment and relaxation as much as you can.
