How to focus on what you can control
Keep a structure and routine
Your usual routine may have been disrupted recently. This can add uncertainty and stress to an already challenging time. Creating a new routine can bring structure back into your life. Make sure to include some of the positive self-care and social connection tips from this module in your new routine. Limit your media usage
We are facing a situation that is rapidly changing, so it is understandable that you might want to check social media or the news frequently, to keep up to date. However,
the amount of information available can be overwhelming and can make you feel more stressed and anxious. It is important to keep a balance between staying informed while managing your exposure to the media. If you do find yourself feeling overwhelmed by the amount of news and information you are receiving, start to limit and be selective about what you are reading and listening to. Checking a trusted news source at set times once or twice a day is a manageable way of staying informed. You could also use the Worry Time technique to manage any worries that arise after reading or watching the news. While social media can be a way of keeping people connected, it too has the potential to cause anxiety in a time of crisis. Be mindful of stories and advice that may not be trustworthy, as a lot of what appears on social media can be rooted in opinion rather than fact. If you are friends with people who are overly negative or tend to share information which makes you anxious, it might be worth muting their posts or messages for a few days. Keeping your phone out of the bedroom and trying to maximise your screen-free time every day are further ways of protecting yourself from the flood of unwanted information.
