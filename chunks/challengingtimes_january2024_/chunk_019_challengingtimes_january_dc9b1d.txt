Kindness and self-compassion
Prioritising what’s important to you
On any given day we carry out a number of different roles in the important areas of our lives. These range from your role in work, being a parent or spouse, to the voluntary work you do in your community. Managing to juggle all of these roles and responsibilities, can often be a delicate balancing act. In a time of crisis, this is likely to become even more difficult. During a crisis your life roles and routines can be thrown into turmoil. For instance, if you carry out a job on the frontline of the crisis, it is likely that the demand for your time in this area is going to increase, at the expense of your time in the other areas of your life. Or if you suddenly have to carry out your job from home, you may find that you are also having to care for your children at the same time, essentially carrying out two roles that would ordinarily have been separate. Making time for the important things
In extraordinary circumstances such as this, it is important to recognise that it is impossible to carry out these roles in the way that you normally would. Some things may have to take a backseat for a while and you may have to accept that sometimes “OK” is good enough. Try not to be too hard on yourself. Maybe it’s OK for your child to watch a bit more TV so you can get a piece of work done. Maybe it’s
OK for you to say no to a request from work, that would limit your time with family. In order to be realistic about what you are able to get done in each area of your life, try to prioritise the things that matter the most.
