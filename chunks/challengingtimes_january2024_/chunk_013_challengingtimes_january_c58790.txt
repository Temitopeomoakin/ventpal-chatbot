How to focus on what you can control
Stick to reliable sources of information
As well as limiting how much time you spend reading about the current crisis, it is important to identify reliable sources from which to get your information. Most media coverage is designed to engage its audience, so facts can often be taken out of context or sensationalised. The World Health Organisation website is a good source of reliable information. Check your governmentâ€™s website for the latest information and guidelines for your country.
Reinvent your self care
Your usual self-care activities may not be an option at this time. However, it is at times of increased stress and anxiety that looking after yourself becomes even more important. You can find help with this on our Self-Care page. Self-care also means watching out for unhelpful coping strategies that could feel like they are helping, but might be making things worse, e.g. increased alcohol or food consumption.
Stay connected to others
Having a supportive social network of friends, family and the wider community is essential for maintaining well-being and resilience. This is especially true in a time of crisis, as this network can provide you with valuable support for whatever challenges come your way.
Prioritise your time
Facing a challenging situation can prevent you from carrying out your various roles and responsibilities in the way that you normally would. You may now find yourself in a situation where you are having to do it all at once. Prioritising your time will ensure that you are making time for the important things, while being realistic about what you can achieve.
