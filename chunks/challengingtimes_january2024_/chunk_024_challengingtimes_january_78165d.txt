Creating a family routine
In a time of crisis, sticking to your own routine can be difficult. If you have children it can be even harder to manage your family’s routine alongside your own. Each family now has to adjust to new circumstances of trying to study or work while confined in the same household, without the usual organised social activities outside the home. Structuring the day and creating a new family routine is a way to make this more manageable. The following tips can help you build a routine that suits the whole family. Build the day around mealtimes
Build your daily routine around family mealtimes. One silver lining in the crisis is the opportunity for families to have more healthy home cooked meals. Involve children as much as possible (according to their ages) in planning, preparing, cooking and cleaning up after meals. The more tasks are shared, the more family bonding and shared pride there will be. With older children you can set up a weekly schedule for meals, alternating who is cooking/ washing up and ensuring everyone gets their favourite meal included. Set aside parent work time
Set aside spaces in the day when you can do your own thing while the children are doing their own thing (e.g. homework or play). This might facilitate you doing work projects or taking leisure time. If your children are very young and don’t easily give you space, then you might alternate child minding with your partner throughout the day. If you are parenting alone, then this time might occur when the children are watching TV, napping or asleep in the evening. Through the course of the day, the goal is to alternate between time together and time apart. Creating individual space and time, while in the same house with others,
is the key to coping.
