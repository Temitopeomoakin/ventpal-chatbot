Taking care of yourself
Self-care is crucial during a time of crisis. Looking after yourself is not a luxury, it is an essential part of maintaining your energy levels and your resilience to stress. This is particularly true if you are caring for others.
Airlines advise you to put on your own oxygen mask before helping other people. The same idea goes for self-care - you need to look after yourself first, in order to be there for other people.
Self-care includes caring for your health and spending time on activities you enjoy. You can read about some of the different areas of self-care below.
Everyone has different needs and will find different self-care activities that work for them. Spend some time thinking about the things you need to do to look after yourself,
as well as the things you can realistically do in the current circumstances.
Three of the main aspects of a healthy lifestyle are exercise, diet and sleep.
It may feel strange focusing on yourself and engaging in normal activities, such as exercising, when you are living through a crisis situation. However, at this time it is more important than ever to maintain your strength and physical resilience,
because stress puts a significant strain on your body and mind.
A constructive way to restore yourself when dealing with a challenging situation is to spend time doing things you really enjoy. These could be hobbies, exercise, your work or other personal or creative pursuits.
