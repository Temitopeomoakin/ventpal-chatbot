Making time for what matters most
In extraordinary circumstances, it is important to recognise that it is impossible to carry out these roles in the way that you normally would. Some things may have to take a backseat for a while and you may have to accept that sometimes “OK” is good enough.
Try not to be too hard on yourself. Maybe it’s OK for your child to watch a bit more TV so you can get a piece of work done. Maybe it’s OK for you to say no to a request from work, that would limit your time with family. In order to be realistic about what you are able to get done in each area of your life, try to prioritise the things that matter the most. See the section below for help with this.
Important v urgent
During challenging times, things you may previously have taken for granted, such as taking care of the basic needs and safety of yourself and your family, could suddenly become urgent needs that you have to actively prioritise above everything else.
Stephen Covey’s ‘Time Management Matrix’ is a way of categorising our everyday tasks and activities into 4 different quadrants. This might be a useful tool to help you make sure that important, but perhaps less urgent things don’t get forgotten about but also to help you see what might be things that you can let slide a bit as you manage your day to day life during a crisis.
