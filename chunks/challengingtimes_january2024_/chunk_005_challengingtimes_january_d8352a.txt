Four ways to manage distressing feelings
Journaling
Journaling can be a useful and therapeutic coping method in times of distress. You can use your journal to sort through jumbled thoughts, to solve problems or to manage difficult feelings. Which emotions have you been feeling lately? You might like to make a note of these in your Journal. Worry time
You probably already know that telling yourself to stop worrying or to stop thinking about something usually doesn’t help. In fact, it can make you think about it more! A more useful way to manage worry is to set aside time for worrying. Take ten minutes on a regular basis, where your only task is to worry. We call this Worry Time. 1. Set aside a ten-minute period once or twice a day, at a regular time. Schedule worry times in advance and put them in your diary. Choose a time when you can devote all of your attention to thinking about the things that are worrying you. 2. As your worries and concerns arise during the day quickly write them down and set them aside for your Worry Time. Writing worries down on paper helps to make them clear. Many people find the act of getting worries out of their heads and onto a piece of paper to be comforting. What to do during your Worry Times:
• Categorise the worries you have written down into worries about things you have no control over, and worries about things you can control. • Brainstorm different solutions or actions you might take to deal with any of the worries that you do have some control over. • Think about how you would like to cope with the worries that you can’t control. How can you let go, learn to accept, or live with aspects you cannot change?
