Kindness and self-compassion
Self-compassion is about how you talk to yourself when things aren’t going well.
Stress, disappointment and setbacks are part of life and cannot be avoided entirely.
What you do have control over, however, is how you treat yourself when these negative experiences occur.
Being actively compassionate towards yourself involves being aware of your needs and knowing when things are getting too much. It is not about excusing yourself from mistakes or denying your responsibility in problems. Instead, it focuses on removing negative self-judgements and learning forgiveness and acceptance.
Negative self-talk
Negative self-talk is extremely common. We tend to criticise ourselves, put ourselves down, blame ourselves for problems and ridicule ourselves for faults. We often treat ourselves much more harshly than we would other people.
When something goes wrong, rather than seeing it as a mishap, the negative voice assigns personal blame:
• What is the matter with me?
• Why do I always get things wrong?
• Why can’t I handle everything?
• I am always messing up and ruining things!
Understanding your negative self-talk is the first step towards distancing yourself from constant self-judgement.
