Noticing your negative emotions
You are likely to experience some strong ‘negative’ emotions at this time.
Emotions, even negative ones, communicate important information about the world around us. They are like an internal compass, helping us to make decisions and understand what we need to do.
While some emotions such as fear and anxiety may feel unpleasant, they are helpful because they motivate us to take action and keep ourselves safe.
Fear and anxiety
• These are normal and natural responses to danger and threat. They let us know that we might be in danger and that we need to take steps to keep ourselves safe.
• They are linked to the fight, flight or freeze response in the body. This involves physical changes such as increased heart rate (to pump blood to the arms and legs) and muscle tension (allows you to move more quickly).
• For example, in the current situation you might feel afraid that you or your loved ones will get sick, which motivates you to adhere to the recommended health guidelines (e.g. regular handwashing), which in turn helps to protect you from getting sick.
Sadness
• Sadness is a natural response to loss and setbacks, which are an inevitable part of life.
• Sadness gives you the space to pull back and process what has happened, and it can signal to others that you may need support and comfort.
• At the moment you might feel sad at the loss of your sense of safety, your familiar routines or you might be missing loved ones.
