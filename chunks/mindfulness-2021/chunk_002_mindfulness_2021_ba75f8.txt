How does mindfulness work? Mindfulness works by taking your focus to the present moment and away from other thoughts. The way we think, and what we think about, can affect how we feel and act. For example, if you think or worry a lot about upsetting past or future events, you might often feel sad or anxious. It is understandable to want to stop thinking about difficult things. But trying to get rid of upsetting thoughts can often make us think about them even more. The theory behind mindfulness is that by using various techniques to bring your attention to the present, you can:
• Notice how thoughts come and go in your mind. You may learn that they don't have to define who you are, or your experience of the world, and that you can let go of them. • Notice what your body is telling you. For example, you might feel tension or anxiety in your body, such as a fast heartbeat, tense muscles or shallow breathing. • Create space between you and your thoughts. With this space, you can reflect on the situation and react more calmly. For more information on how mindfulness works, see the Oxford Mindfulness Centre website. This organisation also provides free online mindfulness sessions. "When I feel anxiety building, mindfulness helps me to keep calm by becoming more in touch with the situation." Can mindfulness help treat mental health problems? Studies show that practising mindfulness can help to manage common mental health problems like depression, anxiety and feelings of stress. There is some evidence that mindfulness could help with more complex mental health conditions, such as psychosis and bipolar disorder. But more research is needed in this area. You might find mindfulness very helpful. Or you might feel like it doesn't work or makes you feel worse.
