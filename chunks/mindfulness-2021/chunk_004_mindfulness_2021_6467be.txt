In some cases, the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)
recommends some structured mindfulness-based therapies which have been developed to treat mental health problems.
However, NICE does not recommend using mindfulness-based treatments for social anxiety. This is because there's not enough evidence that it's effective.
"Mindfulness does help me with my mental health issues. It's not the cure and it won't work every single time, but it has helped me to alleviate anxiety and depression by centring my thoughts."
