It is helpful to practise mindfulness regularly. Think about what times might work best for you. If you're attending a mindfulness course, you might also have to travel to weekly sessions, which can be demanding. Wellbeing considerations
For your physical and mental health, it might help to think about the following before trying mindfulness:
• Are the exercises safe for me to do? Some may involve sitting still for long periods of time and focusing on your breath, which might not be suitable for everyone. For example, if you have mobility issues or breathing problems. Talk to your GP or a trained mindfulness teacher if you have any concerns. • Am I prepared to acknowledge my difficult thoughts? This can sometimes be distressing and could make you feel worse at first. If you find the exercises hard to do, then it's best to get advice from a trained professional.
