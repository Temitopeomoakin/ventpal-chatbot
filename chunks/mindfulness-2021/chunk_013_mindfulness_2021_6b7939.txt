Buddhist mindfulness courses
These courses include traditional Buddhist practices of mindful meditation and other mindful techniques, in the context of Buddhist teaching. These are likely to promote general mental wellbeing rather than tailored treatment for specific health problems.
How to find Buddhist mindfulness courses
These courses are usually taught at Buddhist centres. See Buddhanet's World Buddhist
Directory to find a Buddhist centre near you. Contact them directly to see what they offer.
Self-guided resources
There are many self-guided resources to help you through different mindfulness exercises. Apps, books and audio – such as CDs and podcasts – are typically less structured than online courses.
Self-help resources have no formal regulation, and vary greatly in quality and cost. This can make it hard to judge what might work for you. But in general, it's a good idea to look for a course or resource that:
• is designed by qualified mindfulness teachers
• gives you clear information about its potential benefits and risks
• provides information about research studies that have explored how effective it is
• is supported by the NHS or a mental health organisation
• has been recommended to you by someone you trust.
Many people practise mindfulness online or use a smartphone app to help. Online resources might be useful when you're feeling less able to engage in face-to-face support.
For support with using digital mental health tools, see our information on staying safe online.
How to find self-guided resources
For books and audio:
• Take a look at the reading lists for mindfulness books on Reading Well and
Overcoming.
• Try visiting your local library or bookshop to find appropriate titles.
• Search for mindfulness podcasts on streaming platforms or online.
