Brief taster sessions and informal mindfulness groups are also common.
How to find introductory courses, taster sessions and groups
You might find that these are organised through your place of work or education, or a local library or community centre.
Some local Mind branches may run mindfulness courses and groups. For a fee, some private teachers may also offer introductory courses.
"I went on a mindfulness course once a week for about eight weeks. It covered body mindfulness, mindful eating, mindful walking, mindful environmental awareness and more."
Formal mindfulness courses (MBCT and
MBSR)
Some structured mindfulness therapy programmes have been developed to treat specific problems. The most well-established courses are:
• Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) for depression and anxiety.
• Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) for general stress. It can also help you manage long-term health conditions.
In some cases the NHS recommends these treatments, as studies show that they can work well. But availability on the NHS varies across the country and waiting lists can be long.
Different courses may have slightly different structures, but in general they:
• are delivered by qualified practitioners
• last for a fixed number of sessions, across a specific time frame – typically a two-hour session, every week for eight weeks, although some courses may offer shorter introductory sessions
• involve group work and group discussion, but you can usually contribute as much as you feel comfortable with
• include a mixture of meditation and daily mindfulness exercises, which you're asked to practise between sessions.
