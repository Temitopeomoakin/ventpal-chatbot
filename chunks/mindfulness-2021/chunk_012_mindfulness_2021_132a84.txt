Some other types of talking therapies use mindfulness techniques, such as dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT).
How to find formal mindfulness courses
To find a formal mindfulness course near you, you can:
• arrange to talk to your GP
• search via the online NHS service finder
• look in the private sector, but this will cost money.
You can find out more on the MBCT website, or see our pages on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and talking therapy and counselling.
"As the course starts, it isn't always clear exactly how it will help. The encouragement to just do something, to put one foot in front of the other without thinking about it and questioning it too much can be really helpful."
One-to-one private sessions
For a fee, some mindfulness teachers offer one-to-one sessions through the private sector. Some therapists and counsellors also have mindfulness training and can integrate these techniques into their approach.
One-to-one sessions may be expensive. But they are more likely to be tailored to your particular situation and won't include group work.
How to find private sessions
You can look for a qualified mindfulness teacher or therapist in your local area through:
• the online search tool of the British Association of Mindfulness-Based
Approaches (BAMBA), which only lists qualified teachers
• one of the professional bodies listed in our information on how to find a private therapist.
