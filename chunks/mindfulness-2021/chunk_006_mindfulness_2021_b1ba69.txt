For more information on meditation and yoga, see our page on types of complementary and alternative therapies. The above examples are not the only ways you can practise mindfulness. So many activities can be done mindfully. Different things work for different people, so if you don’t find one exercise useful, try another. You can also try adapting them to suit you and make them easier to fit in with your daily life, such as mindfully cooking dinner or folding laundry. Some people find practising mindfulness in nature can have extra benefits – for suggestions, see our page on ideas to try in nature. For more general examples of exercises to try, see our page on relaxation exercises. 5
