When could I use problem solving?
Finding solutions
Problem solving can be used any time you have a problem or difficulty and need to come up with a solution.
It could be used to tackle anything from a life changing decision like which house to buy or which job to take, to what you should do at the weekend.
Low mood, anxiety and stress all have an impact on our ability to problem solve and sometimes the way we are feeling and our emotions make it difficult to make decisions.
The problem solving technique described in this workbook provides a useful tool which should help us to work through a problem and come up with a solution objectively.
Achieving goals
Problem solving can also help you to achieve goals you set yourself as you can use the techniques to overcome obstacles that may get in your way.
The steps in this workbook should allow you to work through different options to help you to come to the best possible solution. By committing to a decision, worry and stress should reduce and we should feel more hopeful. We want to be able to think creatively of a variety of ideas, not just a few. For this we use brainstorming which helps to increase our flexibility and creativity. It also helps us concentrate energy on solving the task (“How can I go forward?”) rather than negative emotions and thoughts
(“Why does everything go wrong?”).
Reflect
Consider how you have currently been managing your problems.
