Problem solving - the six steps
Step 5: Action plan continued…
Any concerns about the plan
Things to consider
Are there any changes you would like to make to this action plan?
Also note any concerns you might have about carrying it out optimally – Do you think implementing your plan might be a problem in itself? If so, problem solve it!
Make sure that your solution is SMART:
• Specific – what, when, where, with who?
• Measurable – how will you know you have completed this activity?
• Achievable – do you have everything you need to achieve this?
• Realistic – is it realistic?
• Time-focused – what time, what day, for how long?
