Problem solving - the six steps
Step 1: Write down the problem
The problem is…
Can this problem be changed? Based on your answer, what is your major goal? Remember to be realistic.
What are some barriers to this goal? (obstacles, conflicting goals,
reduced resources, unknown/unfamiliar, complexity, emotional difficulties)
• Be specific, describe who, what, when, where, how and why. The more specific you are about what the problem is, the more likely it is that you will find a workable solution. For example, rather than writing ‘financial problems’ you might put ‘I have
£3000 of credit card debts’.
• User clear language and only facts, not assumptions.
• If the problem is large, break it down into smaller ones and develop a series of
“mini goals”.
