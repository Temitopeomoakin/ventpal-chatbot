Problem solving - the six steps
Step 4: Choose a solution
Identify the solutions you rated highly (that is those greater than six). If none were rated this high, try to generate a few more and continue the process.
If there are a few ideas rated at least a six ask yourself if you think you can actually carry them out. If “yes”, include these ideas as part of your overall action plan. If not,
identify other potentially effective solutions and continue this process.
