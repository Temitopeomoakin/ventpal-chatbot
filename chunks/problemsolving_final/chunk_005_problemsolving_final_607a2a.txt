Problem solving - the six steps
Step 2: Write out as many solutions as you can think of
Quantity principle – quantity leads to quality
It is more important to get many solutions as this increases your chances of eventually identifying high-quality alternatives. If you wanted to buy a shirt in a specific size and style,
then a large shop with more variety is more likely to have the one that suits your preferences. Remember that it’s important to write down your list of ideas.
Deferment principle – do not judge the solutions
Record every idea that comes to mind to increase the number of ideas. If you reject ideas it will limit your creative thinking. If an idea seems silly or unrealistic it can spark another possible idea. Alternatively, two ideas that initially seemed weak could merge to generate a reasonable idea. The only rule is that the ideas should be relevant to the problem. If you notice yourself judging the ideas tell yourself to “stop” and remind yourself that it will cut down creativity.
Think of strategies and tactics – greater variety for better quality ideas
• Strategies – general courses of action you can take
• Tactics – specific steps to put a strategy into action
Look over your list, identify the strategies and group the alternative solutions into common themes. If any strategies have few specific tactics, try to generate more. Try to think of more strategies and more new tactics for those strategies.
Even the most ridiculous solutions should be considered. Even if you know you won’t choose this option, it helps to get you thinking about your problem creatively.
