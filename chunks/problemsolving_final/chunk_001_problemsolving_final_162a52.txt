What can problem solving do for me?
Problem solving
Problems and obstacles appear constantly in our lives and we all have different problem solving abilities.
Some people are better at solving problems in certain areas of their lives than others.
Some problems or obstacles that come up can be more difficult to solve than others.
Meanwhile, others may leave us feeling overwhelmed and helpless.
The ability to problem solve effectively has the following benefits:
• Improves how we manage and control our feelings
• Enhances ability to cope with a variety of stressful situations
• Helps protect against common emotional problems such as stress, worry,
depression and anxiety
• Can help us to feel more optimistic and hopeful
• Develops flexibility in the way we think about problems and our ability to implement solutions.
Tabletop metaphor
Think of a table and imagine the tabletop is you and your existing coping strategies and the table legs are the aspects in your life that you have to support you (e.g. supportive boss, family you can talk to).
If the tabletop or legs are weak then the table will not be able to support much weight and will break if you put too much pressure on it (stressors). If you can strengthen the tabletop or legs then it will be able to support more weight.
By using effective problem solving, we are strengthening our coping style and ability.
This means we will be able to cope when stress is added.
Reflect
Consider what problem(s) you may be experiencing currently in your life that you may be able to resolve through problem solving.
