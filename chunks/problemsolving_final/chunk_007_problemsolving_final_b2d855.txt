Problem solving – the six steps
Step 3: Decide which solution is most effective
Go back to the solutions list and cross out any that are “obviously” ineffective. Re-write the “top” 3-5 below and note several positive and negative consequences (personal, social, short-term, long-term) for each. Then rate the solution using a scale of 1
