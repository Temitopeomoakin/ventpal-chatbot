Solutions:
If you get stuck and cannot think of many alternatives try the following to help stimulate creativity:
• What would someone else do? This could be anyone. It could be someone you admire like the Dalai Lama, a character from a television programme, a soldier, a relative or a sports hero, from Simon Cowell to Kermit the Frog:
What advice would they give you?
• Use visualisation, imagine the problem and see yourself attempting to cope with it and achieving your aim. Think about different ways to reach that aim.
When using visualisation, notice the situation and what you are feeling,
thinking and doing. Visualisation is a useful technique that can be used to predict obstacles, find solutions and gain hope.
• Combine ideas or modify them to improve ideas or come up with new ones.
• Take a break if you experience a block, go away from the task and come back a couple of hours later.
