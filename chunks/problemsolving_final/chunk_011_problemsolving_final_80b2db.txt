Problem solving - the six steps
Step 6: Evaluate
What happened after you carried out your action plan? (Can include various personal, social, short-term, and long-term consequences that occurred if appropriate)
How would you rate your overall satisfaction? Consider effects on others as well as yourself
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Not satisfied Very at all satisfied
Reflect
Was the problem resolved to your satisfaction?
If YES: reward yourself!
…and remember to practice, practice, practice!
If NO: go back through the steps and decide what needs to be changed and why the previous solution did not work.
…did you identify obstacles, generate ideas, make the goal realistic, predict consequences, carry out the plan?
