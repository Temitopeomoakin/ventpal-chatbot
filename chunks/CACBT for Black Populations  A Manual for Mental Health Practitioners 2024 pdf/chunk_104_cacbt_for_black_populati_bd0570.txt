CA-CBT for Black Populations: A Manual for Mental Health Practitioners
The following exercise is adapted from The Anxiety & Phobia Workbook (Bourne, 2005). The therapist can use the following instructions to guide the client. You will do each muscle group once, but feel free to repeat an area if it feels especially tense or tight. This exercise will take about 20 to 30 minutes. For each muscle group, hold the tension for 5 to 10 seconds, then release for 10 to 20 seconds. You should not feel any pain when you are tensing the muscles. As you exhale, imagine the tension in your body flowing away. Picture the muscle becoming smooth and loose after you release the tension. 1. Take three deep abdominal breaths, exhaling slowly each time. Picture tension flowing away from your body as you exhale. 2. Fists – Clench, holding them for 10 seconds, then releasing for 20 seconds. 3. Biceps: Tighten by drawing your forearms toward your shoulders, as if you are “making a muscle.”
4. Triceps – Tighten by extending the arms out straight and locking your elbows. 5. Forehead – Tighten by raising your eyebrows as high as you can. 6. Eyes – Clench your eyelids tightly shut. 7. Jaw – Open your mouth as wide as you can, as if you are yawning. 8. Neck – Pull your head back as if you are going to touch your head to your back. 9. Shoulders – Raise your shoulders up toward your ears. 10. Shoulder blades – Bring your shoulder blades together in the back. 11. Chest – Take a deep breath and hold it. 12. Stomach – Suck in your stomach. 13. Lower back – Arch your back up. Skip this muscle group if you have a lower back pain problem. 14. Calf muscles – Gently pull your toes toward you.
