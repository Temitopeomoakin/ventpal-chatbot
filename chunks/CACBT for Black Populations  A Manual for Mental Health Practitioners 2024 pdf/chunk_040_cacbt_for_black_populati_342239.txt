CA-CBT for Black Populations: A Manual for Mental Health Practitioners
Research shows that many of these attributes hold true for Black communities in general. For example, a 2020 study found that stigma associated with mental illness is high among African, Caribbean and Black communities in Ottawa, with 40 per cent believing that seeking mental health treatment is a sign of personal failure (Ottawa Public Health, 2020).
One of the most important considerations in CA-CBT for Black populations is that the populations are diverse. There is no typical member of Black populations, regardless of whether they are of more recent African or Caribbean heritage. Most members of
Black populations are not immigrants or refugees. Many are at the intersections of different identities and that intersectionality could be key in therapy. They may be first generation, second generation or third generation. They may be a person for whom race and racism are important, or a person for whom religion, ethnicity and cultural heritage is important, or a person whose career trumps everything.
There is no simple recipe for providing CBT in Black populations. Flexibility in the application of cultural adaptations is important,
and understanding the client in front of you, and their specific social and cultural environment, is key.
