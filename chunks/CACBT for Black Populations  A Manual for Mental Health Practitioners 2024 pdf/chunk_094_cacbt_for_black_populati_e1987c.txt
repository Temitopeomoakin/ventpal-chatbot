CA-CBT for Black Populations: A Manual for Mental Health Practitioners
The therapist will repeatedly be helping the client make connections between their emotions (A = affect), their behaviours (B =
behaviours) and their thoughts (C = cognitions). Presenting a simple figure linking these three elements, and providing the client with examples from their life, are good ways to train them to make similar connections on their own. Eventually they will then be able to work out how to make changes that will promote positive outcomes in these three areas. This can be achieved with a very simple diagram and repeated reference to the cycle, using words they are comfortable with. An example of such a diagram can be found in Appendix 2, Handout 7: The A‐B‐C Cycle. It is important for the client to understand that negative self‐talk is usually automatic—it happens so fast and so smoothly that the person is barely aware of it. But they do feel the negative effects. Negative self‐talk usually takes the form of:
• worrying – “what if” thoughts, anticipating the worst
• criticism – pointing out shortcomings, flaws, name‐calling, blaming
• hopelessness/helplessness – what’s the point, I can’t, it will never change
• perfectionism – I should have, it must be, I have to. Negative self‐talk must be actively countered by positive self‐talk. The first step is to identify when negative self‐talk is happening,
and then learn to challenge these thoughts with positive, supportive statements. The client must actively practise this skill of unlearning a problematic cognitive style and learning a health‐promoting cognitive style. With practice, they can learn to recognize when the negative self‐talk is operating and deliberately replace it with positive self‐talk before it leads to negative feelings and behaviours. Work with the client to identify a negative thought, evaluate it and then replace it with positive self‐talk.
