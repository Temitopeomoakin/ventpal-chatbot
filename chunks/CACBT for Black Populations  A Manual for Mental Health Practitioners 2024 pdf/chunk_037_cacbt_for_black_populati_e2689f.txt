CA-CBT for Black Populations: A Manual for Mental Health Practitioners
Incorporating and applying intersectionality in CA-CBT for Black populations is not a one-size-fits-all approach, but rather an ongoing process of understanding and responding to the complex interplay of identities and experiences. By recognizing the intersections of race, gender, class and other social factors, mental health professionals can provide more effective and culturally responsive care that honours the diverse lived experiences of Black clients. Through ongoing self-reflection, education and collaboration with clients, mental health professionals can leverage intersectionality to promote health equity and improve treatment experiences and outcomes for Black individuals facing depression and anxiety.
