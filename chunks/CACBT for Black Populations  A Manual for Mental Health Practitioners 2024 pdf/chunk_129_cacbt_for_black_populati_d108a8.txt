Handout 10—Pictograms
The therapist may want to supply the client with relevant pictograms to keep or post in a place where it will make the client more aware of when it is happening. These pictograms have been designed to be easy‐to‐understand cues for each concept, but the client may have other ideas for representations that communicate the idea most clearly for him or her.
The therapist should help clients come up with examples of ways they apply distortions or myths in their lives; these distortions can be listed during a session or used as the foundation for an exercise to be conducted between sessions. When the client is aware of these negative patterns of thinking, cognitive restructuring can be used to counter them. Statements that challenge these negative thoughts can be brainstormed in session, recorded on the handout and/or developed by clients between sessions.
