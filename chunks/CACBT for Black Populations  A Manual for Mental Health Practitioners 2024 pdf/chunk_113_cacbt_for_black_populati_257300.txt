CACBT for Black Populations  A Manual for Mental Health Practitioners 2024 pdf
A significant experience that needs to be considered is the racialized interpretation of Black assertiveness that often involves the perception of angry Black men and women. Black adolescents and young adults may have experienced harsh discipline for the same attitudes and behaviours that are commended in white peers (Riddle & Sinclair, 2019). Historically, Black populations have been compelled to withhold expressing their attitudes and feelings for fear of harsh reprisals and sometimes fatal consequences. Many who have behaved assertively have often been perceived as aggressive because of racist thinking about Black people being inherently violent and dangerousness. In turn, Black people may have been socialized to stay silent for self-preservation. 66
