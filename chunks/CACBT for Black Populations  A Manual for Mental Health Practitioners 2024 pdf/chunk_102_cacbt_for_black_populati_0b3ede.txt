Relaxation Techniques
The following relaxation techniques are effective strategies for reducing stress. However, the full benefits of these exercises can only be attained with ongoing practice. Breathing Exercises
Breathing exercises can be a good place for people to start learning how to manage physiological tension. These exercises take about five minutes and should ideally be practised at least once a day. The exercises teach the client to put the body in a more relaxed state, with daily practice resulting in a more generalized state of relaxation. These exercises are also useful because the client can practise them almost anywhere and use them whenever they feel stressed or tense. Abdominal Breathing
• Get into a comfortable sitting position. Loosen any tight clothing. • Place the hand on the abdomen. • Inhale through the nose attempting to get air deep into your lungs. You should feel your hand rise as air reaches down to your diaphragm. • Exhale through the nose or mouth (whichever you prefer), letting your body go slightly limp. • Do three sets of 10 breaths. Yoga Breathing
• Inhale to a count of five. • Hold your breath to a count of five. • Exhale slowly, over a count of five. • Take two normal breaths. • Repeat the cycle until five minutes have passed. Progressive Muscle Relaxation
Progressive muscle relaxation is another exercise that can teach clients to reduce tension in their bodies. It can be a useful exercise before bed as it may make it easier to go to sleep. The client may find it helpful to do this exercise while listening to a recorded guide; ideally, the agency can provide recorded instructions (e.g., links to podcasts). Clients can also download progressive muscle relaxation audio instructions.
