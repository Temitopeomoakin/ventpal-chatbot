CA-CBT for Black Populations: A Manual for Mental Health Practitioners
The basic outline of a meditation practice is as follows:
• Find a quiet environment where there is less noise or distractions. You can meditate in a silent space or, if you prefer,
you can play quiet music or relaxing noises in the background (e.g., ocean waves). • Get yourself into a comfortable sitting position. You can sit in a chair or on a cushion on the ground with your legs crossed. It is important that you are physically comfortable. Lying down is not recommended, as you are supposed to maintain a relaxed alertness during meditation; however, work in the position that you find comfortable. • Find something to hold your focused attention. Many people will choose to focus on their own breath, paying attention to the cycle of it moving in and out of the body. Some like to find a mantra, a word or phrase they can repeat every time they exhale (e.g., “Peace” or “in God’s hands”). You can place a picture or candle in front of you to be a focus. It can also be effective to picture an image in the mind and focus your attention on it. • Close your eyes if it’s comfortable and doesn’t interfere with focusing your attention on the object you have chosen. • Breathe deeply, without force, keeping your attention on the object of focus. • When thoughts or daydreams come to mind, observe them as if they are clouds passing by. Do not hold on to them or try to push them away—just watch them drift by. Even people very experienced with meditation have distracting thoughts. With practice, it becomes easier to watch your thoughts drift by without reacting or judging. Do not be troubled if there are distracting thoughts; simply return your attention to the object of focus.
