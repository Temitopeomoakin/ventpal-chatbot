Chapter II, “CA-CBT Considerations,” presents the process of CA‐CBT with Black clients from beginning to end, from first contact to after termination. This chapter also details how conventional CBT approaches can be adapted for Black populations.

behavioural experiments, problem‐solving skills, relaxation techniques, social skills training, self‐care and finding meaning and purpose. At the end of this manual, Appendix 1 provides a supplementary reading list and Appendix 2 includes intervention tools that can be used as client handouts. 9
