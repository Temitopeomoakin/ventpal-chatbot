CACBT for Black Populations  A Manual for Mental Health Practitioners 2024 pdf
Give the client a piece of paper with two columns. In one column, they record when they have negative self‐talk or unrealistic negative thoughts. In the other column, they write down positive counterstatements. This exercise helps teach them a three‐step process for promoting health:
1. Notice when the negative thoughts and self‐talk are happening. 2. Stop and interrupt the thoughts to ask questions about whether it is a realistic or fair thought. 3. Replace the negative thought/self‐talk with a deliberate positive statement. Appendix 2, Handout 6: Thought Record provides an example of a more detailed recording worksheet. Use it with the client to facilitate a discussion in the therapy session and for the client to record their experiences independently. 58
