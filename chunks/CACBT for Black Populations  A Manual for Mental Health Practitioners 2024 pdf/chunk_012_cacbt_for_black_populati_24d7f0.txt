CA-CBT for Black Populations: A Manual for Mental Health Practitioners
Though the concept of cultural safety was originally developed for Indigenous populations, its extension to racialized and/or marginalized groups is useful (Baker, 2007). In CA‐CBT, the notion of cultural safety draws attention to several factors. For instance:
• the power dynamics that arise from racism
• the dominance of Eurocentrism in health care organizations
• the under‐representation of certain racialized groups as providers of health care
• the historical and contemporary power relationships that exist because many immigrant groups originate from countries that have been colonized by European nations
Cultural safety thus speaks directly to the issue of power. The dynamics engendered by racism promote stereotypes about emotionality, anger, pain thresholds and intellect (to name a few). This has resulted in sustained patterns of implicit bias expressed in erroneous assessments. Developing cultural safety requires understanding how historical and current practices contribute to racial stereotypes and anxieties that can impede communication and therapeutic relationship building. Trust building may be a bigger challenge precisely because of the persistence of racializing encounters, therefore influencing racialized persons’ unfavourable perceptions and the realities of mental health services and poorer clinical encounters. When care is not considered safe, members of Black and racialized populations are reluctant to use services. When they do use them, retention rates may be shortened due to feelings of humiliation and alienation or perceived racism. Not surprisingly, this can affect outcomes. Clearly, many health professionals treat people based on their own assumptions and stereotypes, creating anxieties that undermine effective service delivery (McKenzie, 2003; Papps & Ramsden, 1996). Cultural safety places responsibility on professionals to (Kearns & Dyck, 1996):
• consider the context in which they are offering care
• examine whether their approach or service design negatively affects particular groups
• understand and deal with the probability that their interactions may be harmful
• recast their practice in a way that minimizes possible negative impacts due to culture.
