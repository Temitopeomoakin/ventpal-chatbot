CA-CBT for Black Populations: A Manual for Mental Health Practitioners
• work, education
• nationality, immigration history and status (if applicable)
The therapist should explore and assess the client’s unique background and experiences to understand how their intersecting identities of race, gender, sexuality, socioeconomic status and immigration history, if applicable, influence their mental health and presenting issues. Ask questions like, “What forms of discrimination or barriers do you encounter in your daily life?”
Presenting Problems
• Tell me about what has been happening. • What happened before this started? What are typical situations (onset, frequency, intensity)? • What do you think caused these problems? • What thoughts, actions, emotions and physical response accompany stressful situations? • How well are you functioning compared to “normal”? o What would other people say? (Who?) o How are you sleeping and eating? What is your energy level and interest in socializing and doing other activities? Any changes in these areas? • How often do you consume caffeine, nicotine, sugar and processed foods? • How often do you use alcohol or other substances? • Have you seen these problems before—in yourself or in others? Do they run in the family? • What has been done to attempt to deal with these problems? o Ask about outcomes (positive and negative) of any other consultations, including seeking support from friends and family. o Ask specifically about clergy, complementary health practitioners, folk healers, use of herbs, bush teas, and more so the client knows it is acceptable to discuss alternative forms of healing or health practitioners. If any have been consulted, ask about positive or negative effects. o Inquire about experience completing any screening instruments (e.g., CES-D, discussed on page 31). Were there any surprises? What are the most bothersome symptoms? o Any thoughts about death or suicide?
