Social Skills Training
Social skills training refers to a wide range of cognitive‐behavioural interventions designed to help clients practise skills for social interactions and build their confidence for these interactions. Assertiveness training is one of the most common forms of social skills training. Learning assertiveness may help clients that are easily intimidated in situations where they feel uncertain of themselves or disrespected by others. Other areas for social skills training may include:
• asking for help
• praising someone
• expressing anger or disappointment
• standing up for self or others
• setting limits on someone else’s behaviour
• approaching someone for friendship
• seeking services. Social skills training typically involves identifying a situation that is causing stress or distress, breaking down the aspects of the situation that are linked to the distress (thoughts, behaviours) and working with the client to develop potential strategies for responding that counter negative thoughts, behaviours and/or impulses used in the past. The therapist should encourage the client to rehearse interactions in session and then practise the strategies between sessions in the “real world.”
Assertiveness Training: Special Considerations
Assertiveness is defined by the following behaviours (Wood & Mallinckrodt, 1990):
• socially appropriate refusals to give in to the requests of others
• appropriate expressions of opinions and feelings
• appropriate expressions of one’s own requests. It differs from aggressiveness in that it is not motivated by anger and it does not operate at the expense of other people’s feelings or needs. In Canada, assertive behaviour is considered appropriate and necessary for functioning effectively in mainstream environments such as workplaces and government institutions. However, many clients from racial minorities struggle with assertiveness because it is not consistent with the way they have been taught to present themselves or interact with authority figures.
