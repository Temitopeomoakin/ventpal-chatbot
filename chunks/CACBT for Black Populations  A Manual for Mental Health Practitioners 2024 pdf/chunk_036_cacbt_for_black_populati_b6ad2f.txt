CACBT for Black Populations  A Manual for Mental Health Practitioners 2024 pdf
The literature suggests using culturally familiar language and resources, such as culturally familiar scenarios or role-plays, during sessions (Lechner et al.,
2013). This entails understanding how cultural factors intersect with other identities to shape the client’s worldview and experiences. • Assessment and formulation: Assessing and formulating cases through an intersectional lens enables clinicians to develop tailored treatment plans that address each client’s unique needs. Mental health professionals should consider how intersections of identity and various social experiences have contributed to how symptoms present. By acknowledging the impact of societal stigma surrounding mental health within the Black community, professionals can work collaboratively with their Black clients to challenge and overcome these barriers. • Collaborative goal setting: Collaborating with clients to set treatment goals involves considering their cultural values,
strengths and barriers. This collaborative approach empowers clients to actively participate in their healing journey and advocate for themselves within various systems, including health care, education and employment, to address systemic barriers to mental health and well-being. 26
