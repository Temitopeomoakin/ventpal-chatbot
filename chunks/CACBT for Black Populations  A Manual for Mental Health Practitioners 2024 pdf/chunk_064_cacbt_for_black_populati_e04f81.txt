It can be helpful to use diagrams to show the links that are being made to come up with the conceptualization and the proposed treatment plan. The therapist should also do the following:
• Point out the client’s strengths and resources (e.g., resiliency, familial support, spirituality or religion). • Explain that the problem list is designed to be as inclusive as possible, but it is not necessary to deal with everything on it;
the client can add or eliminate items as needed. • Give specific examples of the links between thoughts, feelings and behaviours, using the client’s language and stories. Again, diagrams may help explain the connections more clearly. • Check that the conceptualization fits with the client’s views of the problems and make modifications based on the client’s feedback. • Explain how CA‐CBT can help with these problems, being specific about interventions directed at thoughts, behaviours,
emotional/physical distress and environmental conditions (skills that could be developed). Discuss other options (e.g.,
medication, settlement services, financial counselling) that may be available to the client for dealing with their problems. These recommendations are designed to ensure that the client can make informed decisions about engaging in CA‐CBT. The client should have a clear idea of what the explanation is for their presenting problems and how cognitive and behavioural interventions could bring some relief. The client should also know what other options are available to them so they do not feel constrained in pursuing other options or coerced into accepting this treatment. 43
