CACBT for Black Populations  A Manual for Mental Health Practitioners 2024 pdf
Racialized outcomes may result from the meetings of two groups that are unequal in status, unequal in material advantage and unequal in colonial histories. Even in circumstances where service providers are members of populations that experience discrimination, their affiliation with the health care system associates them with these inequities. Cultural safety practices provide a way to raise questions about how health professionals and systems are positioned relative to their clients and relative to the system of health care in which they practise and how that may affect the care they provide. One of its most significant contributions may be in heightening awareness that professionals require specific preparation to provide safer health practices in a multicultural context and must attend to power imbalances inherent in the health care context. This preparation may include developing cultural safety policies and training in collaboration with Black populations and offering cultural safety training and opportunities for leadership and supervision in culturally competent and/or culturally safe practices (National Aboriginal Health
Organization, 2008). 13
