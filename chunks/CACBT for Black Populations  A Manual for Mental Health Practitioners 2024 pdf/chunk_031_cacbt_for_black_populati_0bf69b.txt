CACBT for Black Populations  A Manual for Mental Health Practitioners 2024 pdf
From 1918–1965, certain universities (e.g., Queen’s) banned Black applicants to their medical programs (Canadian Press, 2019). This further exacerbates the issue that has been cited countless times regarding the lack of representation throughout the sector to reflect the populations it serves (BHA & HCSL, 2020). Addressing Internalized Racism
Addressing anti-Black racism in structured psychotherapy can take many forms. One involves using strategies to tackle internalized racism. Two articles (Steele & Newton, 2022; Wallace et al., 2020) discuss this topic, focusing on African American women experiencing depression and anxiety. Addressing internalized racism within CBT involves deconstructing the source of the client’s negative schemas and core beliefs,
and helping them learn to respond with self-compassion while they develop new, and more positive, ways of viewing themselves and others. Using a case study of a 27-year-old African American graduate woman experiencing depression and anxiety at work
(Steele & Newton, 2022) and a 36-year-old married African American woman presenting with depression and panic episodes
(Wallace et al., 2020), the articles discuss strategies to address internalized racism in CBT:
• Understand the client’s lived experience through their cultural lens and validate their experience of oppression. • Help the client make culturally preferred changes that minimize stressors, increase personal resources and build skills for more effective interactions with the social environment. • Create a list of culturally related strengths and supports in the therapeutic process. 23
