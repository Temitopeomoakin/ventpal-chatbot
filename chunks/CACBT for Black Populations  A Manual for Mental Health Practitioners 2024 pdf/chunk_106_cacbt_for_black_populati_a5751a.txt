Visualizations
Visualizations can be a good way for clients to evoke a sense of peace and distract themselves from negative or anxious thoughts. Help the client design a visualization that is unique to them—perhaps a place they remember or a place where they have always wanted to be. Do not restrict them to places that are realistic. For example, they can imagine themselves floating in a bubble or suspended underwater. Help them paint in the details of their visualization with instructions such as the following:
• Imagine a place where you remember feeling very relaxed and peaceful or can imagine yourself feeling relaxed and peaceful. Close your eyes and picture the way the scene looks, sounds and feels. • Picture yourself walking toward the scene and entering it. Notice how you immediately feel more peaceful as you step into the scene. • Take in the colours that surround you. Notice which colours are brightest and most prominent. • Tune in to the sounds that you hear in that place. Imagine the different sounds, tuning in to each element. Picture yourself turning toward the sounds so you can hear them better. • Imagine the lighting in the place. Think about how it would light the things around you, how it would light you and feel on your skin. • Imagine the temperature in the place and how your body feels. Think about what sensations you would feel on your skin. Visualize what you might be touching, or what you could reach out to touch. • Think about what you would smell. What is it? Where is it coming from? • Think about whether you are alone, or if there is someone there with you. Meditation
Meditation can be useful for both diminishing troubling thoughts and decreasing tension in the body.
