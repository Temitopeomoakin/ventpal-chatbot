CA-CBT for Black Populations: A Manual for Mental Health Practitioners
Liz has been seeing her family doctor because she has headaches, other body pains, digestive problems and insomnia,
but she suspects that these are physical signs of her emotional stress. She says that because of these sleep and health problems she is short‐tempered and always fighting with her husband and shouting at the children. Many of the marital conflicts are brought on by problems with Camille, who is doing poorly in school, fights with her younger brother and is very defiant with her stepfather. Liz thinks that Camille hates her for leaving her behind in Jamaica and resents her stepfather and stepbrother. She lies awake wondering what would have happened if she had not left Jamaica, had not left Camille in Jamaica and had not remarried in Canada. She feels overwhelmed by the situation and feels there is no one she can share it with. She also believes that her work performance is suffering, as she is always tired and in a bad mood—her supervisor has commented on this and she is worried there will be consequences. She works evening shifts and worries about what is going on at home when she is not there. There has been no violence at home, but she says that she feels on edge whenever she is in the house and even more on edge when she is gone. Liz sees herself as someone who can persevere through anything, but she is worn down by the family problems and does not feel strong enough to deal with them. She says her dream of having a reunited family has turned into a nightmare. In this case example, we see that Liz recognizes that she is under emotional stress and that it is affecting how she feels physically and emotionally.
