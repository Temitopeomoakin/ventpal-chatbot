CA-CBT for Black Populations: A Manual for Mental Health Practitioners
Intersectionality
As mental health professionals, our understanding of cultural diversity and its impact on mental health outcomes is critical. Recognizing the complexities of identity and experience, particularly within Black populations, is essential for providing effective care. One such lens through which we can understand these complexities is intersectionality. Coined by Kimberl√© Crenshaw in
1989, intersectionality refers to the interconnected nature of social categorizations such as race, class and gender as they apply to a given individual or group, which create overlapping and interdependent systems of discrimination or disadvantage. Intersectionality provides a lens through which we can comprehend the multifaceted nature of identity and its intersections with social structures. In the context of providing CA-CBT for Black populations, understanding intersectionality is essential. Black individuals do not exist within a vacuum; they navigate a multitude of identities and societal structures that influence their experiences of mental health and well-being. Therefore, incorporating intersectionality into CA-CBT is crucial for improving treatment experiences and outcomes for Black clients. Understanding Intersectionality
Intersectionality emphasizes that individuals hold multiple social identities that intersect and interact, shaping their experiences and opportunities. Intersectionality highlights the concept of multiple marginalizations, wherein individuals may face compounded forms of discrimination and disadvantage due to the intersection of various identities. In the case of Black populations, this can manifest as experiences of racism, sexism, classism and other forms of oppression. It is crucial to recognize that experiences of discrimination and marginalization are not uniform; they vary based on the unique intersections of identities. Intersectionality helps us recognize that oppressed social status is not merely a product of individual perceptions, attitudes and behaviours; rather, our social identities are also wrapped in complex structures of systemic inequalities and/or privilege (Wilson et al., 2019). Incorporating Intersectionality in CA-CBT
Mental health professionals must recognize and validate the various intersecting identities that Black clients hold.
