Anti-Black Racism and Mental Health
Mental Health Outcomes
A 2019 study based on Canadian Community Health Survey data reported that the prevalence of everyday discrimination attributed to race was significantly higher among those who self-identified as Black (30.8 per cent) compared to those who selfidentified as white (2 per cent) (Hyman et al., 2019). Likewise, according to the 2022 Toronto Social Capital Study, Black
Torontonians faced more discrimination on a regular basis than white residents, with racism being the most common form of discrimination. The study showed that compared to other racialized groups, Black Torontonians were more likely to be looked down upon and reported more frequent discrimination in the form of microaggressions and everyday events of racism. For example, compared to white Torontonians, Black people experienced others being fearful or afraid of them at least a few times a month (9 per cent vs 18 per cent). There is a growing body of research suggesting a positive correlation between racial discrimination and declining mental health
(Williams & Mohammed, 2013; Williams, 2019). Despite gaps in data and research on the specific intersections of anti-Black racism and mental health, existing evidence demonstrates racial disparities for Black populations:
• In Ontario, Caribbean immigrants have a 60 per cent higher risk of psychosis and refugees from East Africa have a 95 per cent higher risk of psychosis (Anderson et al., 2015a). These rates do not reflect the rates of psychosis in their countries of origin, which suggests that social factors associated with migration may contribute to the risk of psychotic disorder (Anderson et al., 2015a). • According to a 2020 Statistics Canada survey, 32 per cent of individuals from Black populations compared to 24 per cent of white counterparts report experiencing symptoms of anxiety (Mental Health Commission of Canada, 2021).
