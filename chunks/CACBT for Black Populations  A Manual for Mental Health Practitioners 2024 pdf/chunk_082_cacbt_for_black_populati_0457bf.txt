Tasks for the Last Few Sessions
In the final sessions of treatment, important tasks include reviewing progress, setting future goals, establishing realistic expectations and ensuring the client knows what to do if depression returns. Review Progress
It is easy for clients to lose sight of the progress they have made during the sessions, so the therapist must help them see how far they have come. This can be done informally by discussing the issues that first brought the client to treatment and comparing the past situation to the present. It can also be done in a more structured way by reviewing the problem list that was made at the beginning of therapy, or reviewing the assessments the client has completed. Looking at where they started and comparing it to the present situation can be a very empowering way for the client to recognize the work they have done. Set Future Goals
The client may be inclined to see the termination of treatment as the end of the work they are doing on themselves; to counter this, setting future goals will help communicate that they are in a lifelong process of improving themselves and their relationships. The termination sessions are a good time to talk about how accomplishments made during treatment can be generalized to other situations. Use these final sessions to set goals in new areas, discussing how the client can adapt the skills they have learned to these new situations. In either case, the therapist should encourage the client to see how skills in areas such as problem‐solving,
self‐monitoring and relaxation will continue to be useful to them. It is also a way to reinforce the idea that it is important to keep practising the skills so they are available in times of increased pressure or stress. 51
