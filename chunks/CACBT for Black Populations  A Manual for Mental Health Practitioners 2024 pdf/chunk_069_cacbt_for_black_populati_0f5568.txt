CACBT for Black Populations  A Manual for Mental Health Practitioners 2024 pdf
Although she does not talk about feeling depressed, her descriptions of physical problems, stress,
anger and irritation are consistent with the idioms of psychological distress documented among North American populations of
African descent and identified by the community members consulted in the development of this manual. Liz indicates feelings of hopelessness about her family situation, but also displays some confidence in her own personal strength and awareness that her personal resources are being overwhelmed. A CA‐CBT conceptualization of Liz’s presenting problem might include some of the following factors:
• Environmental experiences contributing to depression – Work schedule, job stress and interpersonal tension with supervisor,
conflict with husband and daughter. For example: exploration of concerns about anti-black racism at Liz’s place of employment. Black women are often treated unfairly at work and this may influence her perception of her performance and any associated repercussions in the workplace. • Core beliefs – I’m responsible for everything that’s happening
• Automatic thoughts – It’s all my fault; everyone is blaming me; I deserve to be blamed
• Feelings – Sadness, anger, guilt, anxiety
• Actions or behaviours – Isolation, irritability
• Environmental constraints on actions/behaviours and feelings – Maintaining family peace (including well‐being of her son). The proposed interventions and preliminary treatment plan that follow are linked specifically to reducing the symptoms that are troubling Liz, and also to her desire to fulfil larger goals of family harmony and personal well‐being. 45
