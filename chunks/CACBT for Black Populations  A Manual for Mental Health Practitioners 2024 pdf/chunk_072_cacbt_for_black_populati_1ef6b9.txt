The therapist will want to transition from checking in to setting an agenda for that day’s meeting, and can conceivably suggest, “It sounds like this is something that is really on your mind. Would you like to focus on that for today’s session?”
An important aspect of the check‐in, particularly in the first active treatment session, is to determine how the client feels about the feedback they have received about their problems. The client can emerge from the feedback session feeling encouraged and hopeful about positive changes in the future, discouraged and overwhelmed, or somewhere in between. These feelings merit attention in the process and checking in about the client’s thoughts and reflections between sessions is a useful practice to integrate into sessions. Even if exploring this does not form the basis for setting the agenda of the day’s session, remember that the client’s beliefs about the potential for change has an impact on treatment outcome. Checking in about how the client believes the process is working for them is an important opportunity to correct any misconceptions they may be having, foster hope and encourage positive actions and attitudes they are bringing to the process. 47
