CA-CBT for Black Populations: A Manual for Mental Health Practitioners
The therapist needs to be careful about labelling these thought patterns as cognitive distortions because the client may perceive this as implying that all their problems are “in their heads.” This may be particularly true among clients from Black populations as there is an unfortunate history of Black populations being labelled as deficient based on mainstream ideologies about what is the correct way of being (Henry, 1993). Consequently, clients may be sensitive to any suggestion that they are being minimized or subjected to racist assumptions (McLean et al., 2003). The client may have learned this way of thinking from someone who judged, criticized or rejected them. Or they may have learned to think this way to cope with multiple negative experiences and situations in which they were taught to blame themselves or become distressed instead of trying to change situations beyond their control or influence. Rather than talking with the client about their “distortions” or “distorted thinking” that must be replaced by “rational” thoughts, it may be more useful to talk to them about thoughts they have that are “extreme” or “unhelpful” (Williams & Garland, 2002). This wording will help the client realize that their thoughts are not based on reality and are contributing to their negative feelings and behaviours. Talking with the client about what kind of situations evoke these thoughts and where they may have come from can help them understand the thoughts as learned ways of responding that can be replaced with new learning that will promote more positive feelings and behaviours. The client may identify with the notion of having been taught ideas that are wrong and corrosive, as this interpretation resonates with the way many people of Black populations experience the school system in Canada and elsewhere (Dei et al., 1997).
