Problem‐Solving Skills
The core of problem‐solving skills is to coach the client through a sequence of activities that will change an overwhelming situation into a set of manageable problems that can be addressed through clear, definable actions. The client may think they have very few options until they learn, through this process, to recognize a fuller range of choices. Recognize choosing not to take action as a viable course of action. The therapist may want to remind the client of the serenity prayer as a tool for making peace with situations that cannot be resolved by individual action. At the same time, the therapist should help the client recognize that they may not be powerless in some situations and may be able to take action independently or with help from others. The client should identify a problem they would like to try solving. Topics discussed during the check‐in or personal project review may identify a problem linked to the treatment goals, but the client should choose the example they will use for the exercise. The process will seem cumbersome at first, but assure the client that with practice, it will become easier. Problem‐Solving: Step‐by‐Step
Guide the client through this six‐step problem‐solving process:
1. Define the problem. Make sure it is very specific and, if necessary, broken up into smaller problems that you can work through one at a time. 2. Brainstorm ways to deal with the problem. Put down everything you can think of, no matter how unlikely. 3. Choose the best option by looking at the pros and cons of each solution. 4. Generate a detailed action plan for the best option. Address the “who,” “what,” “why,” “when” and “where” of the plan. 5. Put the plan into action.
