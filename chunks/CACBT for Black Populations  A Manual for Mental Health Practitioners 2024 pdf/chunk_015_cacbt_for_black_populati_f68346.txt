CACBT for Black Populations  A Manual for Mental Health Practitioners 2024 pdf
At an individual level, this acknowledges the client’s experience as the recipient of care. At a community level, it acknowledges the expertise that community members can contribute to designing more appropriate services and interventions (Nguyen, 2008). In developing this CA‐CBT manual, we consulted various stakeholders. Community members said they believe that improving access to mental health services for Black populations will require some flexibility within and between organizations. Recommendations include the following:
• Extend service delivery periods to accommodate some clients’ desires to lengthen the termination phase of treatment (e.g.,
gradual tapering of sessions, booster sessions) or temporarily halting treatment until life disruptions have settled. • Extend office hours outside conventional work hours (i.e., evenings, weekends) to accommodate work and child care commitments. • Provide child care services or child care expense reimbursement to facilitate access by clients with young children. • Seek partnership with community agencies, as community settings may be preferable to attending appointments at a hospital or mental health centre. • Engage places of worship, primary care settings and community centres in mental health promotion campaigns aimed at improving knowledge about and attitudes toward mental health, and disseminating information about available resources for seeking help. These efforts may make it easier for people in the community to disclose mental health problems to their clergy,
physicians, family and friends, who are often their first resource for seeking help and referrals. 15
