• When?
• Where?
• Who’s there?
Feelings:

Self‐Talk:
• Thoughts going through your head
Beliefs/Assumptions/Rules:
• What do those thoughts say about me?
• What do those thoughts say about other people?
• What do those thoughts say about the way the world works?
• What is the proof that these beliefs/assumptions/rules are true?
• Is there evidence that these beliefs/assumptions/rules are not 100 per cent true?
• What is a possible alternate belief? What supports this alternate belief?
• How could I test this alternate belief? (action plan)
