CA-CBT for Black Populations: A Manual for Mental Health Practitioners
At its most basic level, the conceptualization describes the relationships between automatic thoughts, feelings and the actions that people take. It can help explain to the client that part of what makes it difficult to deal with stress are the automatic thoughts that go through our heads when a stressful situation arises. These thoughts pop into our heads so quickly and easily that it can be difficult to notice them, but they still have a strong effect on our emotions. When reviewing stressful situations, it will be helpful to explore what automatic thoughts were going through the client’s head at the time and how these thoughts triggered emotional and physical reactions and behaviours. Encourage the client to consider the following:
• What makes your stress worse? • What makes it better? • What happens to your body when you are stressed? • What kind of thoughts come into your head? • How do you act when you are stressed? • What do other people notice when you are stressed? • What aspects of your life are affected by stress? What aspects aren’t affected? Review this with the client at the next session, helping them to make connections between positive and negative cycles in their life. This exercise can also be done in the session by having the client recall stressful incidents during the past week. A worksheet for this exercise can be found in Appendix 2, Handout 3: Stress Diary. Because CA‐CBT also considers environmental influences, the conceptualization (Figure 2) needs to address how the environment has contributed to the cycle through:
• past and current experiences that form the basis for beliefs, assumptions and expectations
• environmental stressors that trigger or reactivate negative beliefs, assumptions and expectations
• environmental constraints that affect options the client has for taking action and expressing feelings in a way that promotes health.
