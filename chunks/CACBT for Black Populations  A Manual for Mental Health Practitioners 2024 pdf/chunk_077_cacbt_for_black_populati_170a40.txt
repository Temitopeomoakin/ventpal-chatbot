Toward the end of the session, the therapist should work with the client to establish a therapeutic exercise to do between sessions. With clients from Black populations, time should be scheduled during the sessions for therapeutic exercises so the therapist can problem‐solve ways to reduce barriers to completing the exercise with the client. Scheduling the exercise time also communicates its importance. Talk to the client about what will help them follow through on the commitment (e.g., setting up reminders in a calendar, attaching the activity to an existing commitment in the schedule, etc.). Self‐monitoring or journaling activities could be combined with activities such as downtime, going for a walk, prayer or meditation. Close the Session
Close the sessions by reviewing the work that has been done in the session, tying it to the overall goals of the treatment. Both the client and the therapist will benefit from regularly reviewing the treatment goals, articulating what is being done to accomplish them and reviewing areas in which the client is making positive progress. The therapist should reserve time after the session to document progress and add the session notes to the client’s file. 49
