A guideline for this exercise can be found in Appendix 2, Handout 4: Identifying
Feelings. The automatic thoughts and images that accompany everyday situations give rise to different feelings. Often referred to as self‐
talk, this chatter is based on the beliefs, principles, assumptions and rules that people have learned and used to navigate their relationships with themselves, other people and the environment around them. Since thoughts are such a large component of emotional experience, it is important to help the client notice how their thoughts affect their feelings. It can be a valuable exercise to have the client write down their self‐talk and think about how their personal experiences have taught them to look at and understand the world in a certain way. An example of such an exercise is available in Appendix 2, Handout 5: Noticing &
Exploring Self‐Talk. Practise this with the client, and then suggest they try doing it independently between sessions. 54
