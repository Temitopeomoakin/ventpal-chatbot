CA-CBT for Black Populations: A Manual for Mental Health Practitioners
In CA‐CBT, assessment is used to gather (Kleinman et al., 2006):
• information about current feelings, physical sensations, behaviours and thoughts that could be potential targets for intervention
• information about environmental conditions that are the context for the problems and figure out what stressors maintain the situation and what strengths and resources could be strengthened to ameliorate the problem
• ethnocultural information to determine cultural identifications, culture‐based expectations for poor health and good health,
and ways in which the client’s interpretation of culture influences their definition of the problems and their expectations for solving them. The assessment interview can be semi‐structured or unstructured, depending on the level of experience the therapist has with interviewing. An experienced therapist will know how to conduct a conversation with the client that gathers the necessary information while allowing them to tell the story the way they wish. A less --experienced therapist may feel the need to have prompts prepared to ensure they cover the relevant topics. CA‐CBT has been piloted using the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) (Radloff, 1977) to evaluate depression before and after the intervention. CA-CBT has been shown to be effective at improving clinical outcomes using the
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and Beck Depression Inventory (Jesse et al., 2015), the CES-D and the Hamilton
Depression Rating scale (Ward & Brown, 2015). You can use any of these brief self‐report instruments to evaluate the client’s level of depression and as a useful tool for initiating discussion about symptoms they are experiencing. We recommend creating an information package containing the forms that need to be filled out. The first page of the package should have a preamble saying clearly if the forms are to be handed to the receptionist or to the therapist.
