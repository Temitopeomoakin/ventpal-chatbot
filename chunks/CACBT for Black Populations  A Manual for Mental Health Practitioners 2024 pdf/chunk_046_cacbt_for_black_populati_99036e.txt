Assessment
Prior to beginning the assessment, the therapist should remind the client about the tasks for the day’s session. This will begin to familiarize the client with the experience of setting an agenda for each session. If there are consent forms to be completed, these should be done at the beginning of the session and the information in the forms should be used to orient the client to the intervention process. Consent forms can be used to orient the client to the CA‐CBT process, addressing issues such as confidentiality, the length of the intervention process, and the expectations that will be placed on them as clients (e.g., regular attendance, feedback about sessions). Discussing these aspects of the session is part of building a working alliance, as it ensures the client is fully informed about the process and agrees with the goals and tasks involved. 33
