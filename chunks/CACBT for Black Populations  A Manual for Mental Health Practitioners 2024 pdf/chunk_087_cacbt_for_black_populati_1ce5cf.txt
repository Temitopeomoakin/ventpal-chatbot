CACBT for Black Populations  A Manual for Mental Health Practitioners 2024 pdf
Meeting with the therapist every other week toward the end of treatment may address a client’s feeling that they need more time, while providing the opportunity to experience coping without the therapist’s support for longer periods. The client may also approach termination with ambivalence; they may value feeling able to deal with problems independently, but may miss having a relationship in which they were able to be completely open about personal struggles and their experience of depression. This ambivalence may play out with the client becoming less forthcoming toward the end of the treatment as they mentally prepare to move forward without the therapist’s support. With this in mind, the therapist should encourage discussion of the ambivalence about ending the sessions. This may be another time when it makes sense to revisit the idea of what it means to be “strong” and how that includes seeking help when needed, and does not include not ever having any problems again. Reinforce the strength that is demonstrated by taking care of themselves and how this contributes to important goals such as being a strong member of their family and community. Determine the timing of termination by the progress therapist and client feel is being made toward the treatment goals. This is a good topic for regular discussion throughout the treatment process, both to evaluate progress and to demystify the decision‐
making process that will determine when treatment will end. 53
