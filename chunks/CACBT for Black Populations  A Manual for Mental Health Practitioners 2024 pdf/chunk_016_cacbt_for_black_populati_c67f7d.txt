CA-CBT for Black Populations: A Manual for Mental Health Practitioners
Research aimed at reducing barriers and improving the attractiveness of mental health services and programs for underserved populations also supports the following recommendations:
• Mobilize practical resources that remove the barriers to attending therapy, such as providing transportation or reimbursement for transportation (Dixon‐Woods et al., 2006).
• Designate a staff person to consult with CA‐CBT clients regarding their interest and suitability for adjunct services (e.g.,
housing, financial, employment counselling; settlement agencies) if needed (Kohn et al., 2002). At the very least, materials with this information should be made available in waiting areas and in the therapist’s office.
• If fees are necessary, offer a sliding scale to facilitate access by clients with low incomes (Sanders Thompson et al., 2004).
• Actively recruit staff that are representative of the people being served to increase likelihood of service use and break systemic barriers (Wu & Windle, 1980; Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion, 2023). Efforts should be made to employ these staff in diverse capacities to avoid perceptions of tokenism.
