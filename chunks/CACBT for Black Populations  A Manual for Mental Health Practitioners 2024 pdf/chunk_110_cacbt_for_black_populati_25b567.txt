• End the meditation by reflecting on the good that you have done for yourself by practicing this method of focused attention. Some may also wish to end by reflecting on the practice as a way to benefit themselves and all those that that come into contact with them. A prayer may be another way that some people choose to end the meditation practice. Using Prayer as a Meditation Practice
Some clients may be more comfortable with the idea of praying than meditating. Prayer can have the same benefits as meditation, as it is an opportunity to still the mind and to cultivate detachment from problems by turning them over to a higher power. Prayer may be a preferred alternative to meditation practice for clients who are religious. Spirituality and religious practices can also be leveraged to cultivate resilience, instill hope and foster connections. Encourage clients to incorporate breathing practice into their prayer. In the same way that they can deal with distracting thoughts during meditation, they can refocus on breathing or on a phrase or ritual that will return them to the prayer practice. Encourage them to begin and end the prayer practice by reflecting on the good it does for them and how it will make them cope better and be better in their relationships with other people. A potential integration of prayer and meditation could be:
• thanking God for the time and space to speak with them
• praying for themself
• praying for others
• thanking God for the way that prayer will benefit the client and the people around them. 64
