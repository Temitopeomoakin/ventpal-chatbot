Stress Inoculation
Stress inoculation is a technique that the therapist can use to prepare the client for a real‐life situation that they anticipate will be stressful or for exposure to a situation that the therapist is creating to desensitize the client to a stressful situation. The more detailed and realistic the therapist makes the situation in the practice, the more likely the client will be inoculated against stress in the real situation.
Help the client make a list of the negative thoughts and self‐talk that emerge when facing a stressful situation.
Prepare positive, tension‐reducing self‐statements to use:
• before a stressful situation
• during a stressful situation
• after a stressful situation, to help the client recognize and commend themselves for having attempted to cope.
The client should identify stressful situations that they would like to rehearse and prepare. Examples that might serve as good role‐plays include:
• meeting with a family doctor
• a discussion with a family member
• a discussion with an employer
• a job interview
• dealing with a disrespectful person
• asking someone for help.
