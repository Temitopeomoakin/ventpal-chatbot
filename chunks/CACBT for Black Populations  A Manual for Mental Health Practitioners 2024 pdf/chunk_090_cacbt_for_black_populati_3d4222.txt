Cognitive Restructuring
Cognitive Distortions and Myths
Cognitive‐behavioural therapies commonly target a specific category of thought patterns called cognitive distortions. One of the barriers to relieving depression, anxiety or other negative mood states is that the client has learned unhelpful patterns of thinking
—cognitive distortions—which reinforce negative feelings. In other words, cognitive distortions are unrealistically negative thoughts that have been learned in negative situations. Common cognitive distortions include the following:
• all‐or‐nothing thinking – thinking about bad events in terms of them “always” being true, or good events “never” happening or a bad situation staying that way “forever” (e.g., “Nothing good ever happens to me”)
• overgeneralizing – taking a single negative event and assuming it is true all the time (e.g., “All men are bad”)
• mental filter – only paying attention to the bad events that happen and overlooking good events that are just as relevant (e.g.,
ruminating about an argument with a friend during your surprise birthday party organized by other friends)
• disqualifying the positive – rRejecting positive statements from other people (e.g., responding to a compliment on your work with “It must have just been luck”)
• jumping to conclusions/catastrophizing – seizing on one piece of information to conclude that the worst has happened (e.g., a friend is late, so you think she must have gotten into a terrible car accident and died)
• magnification/minimization – seeing negative events as hugely important and positive events as insignificant (e.g., a person playing a game of chess can recount every bad move in great detail, but pays no attention to the many good moves that were made in the same game)
• emotional reasoning – letting the way something makes you feel distort your perception of the situation (e.g., feeling nervous about taking a test convinces you that you are not prepared for the test)
• should statements – holding yourself to an unreasonable standard (e.g., “I should do this right every time”)
• labelling – Applying negative labels to the self inappropriately (e.g., making a mistake and telling yourself [self‐talk] that you are a stupid loser)
• personalization – taking personal responsibility for bad events happening to other people (e.g., your partner is stressed and you decide it must because of something you are doing or not doing; this is all my fault)
• fallacy of change – believing that you can change others when, in fact, you can only change yourself or thinking that everything will get better for you if someone else changes (e.g., believing that your love or effort can stop someone from doing negative things)
• fallacy of fairness – feeling resentful because you think you know what is fair but others will not agree with you (e.g., thinking that your partner should do more to help with the housework because they should see and appreciate what you do)
• fortune‐telling – believing that you know ahead of time how something will turn out (e.g., not wanting to go to a social event because you already “know” you will have a bad time)
• mind reading – imagining what someone is thinking and then reacting as if it were real (e.g., feeling bad because your friend has not responded to an e‐mail message you sent and thinking it is because he is angry with you)
