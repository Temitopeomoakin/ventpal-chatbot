CA-CBT for Black Populations: A Manual for Mental Health Practitioners
It is difficult to assess rates of specific mental illness in surveys cross-culturally in Canada, and a perceived measure where respondents rate their mental health is often favoured. In such surveys, the rates of poor mental health for Black populations in
Canada is greater than the white population and other racialized populations. According to a 2020 survey by Statistics Canada on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, Black respondents were more likely to report having fair/poor mental health as compared to white respondents (27.9% versus 22.9%, respectively). Black populations across Canada were also more likely to report barriers to accessing mental health care or supports (Moyser, 2020). And in a recent analysis of data, Black populations were half as likely to use free, structured psychotherapy services than the white population. According to the 2021 census (Statistics Canada, 2022)
• 1.5 million people (4.3 per cent of Canada’s total population and 16.1 per cent of the racialized population) identify themselves as Black. • Over 40.9 per cent of the Black population are Canadian-born, including individuals with multi-generational Canadian roots as well as children of immigrants. • 32.6 per cent of the Black population were born in Africa—Nigeria (7.1 per cent), Ethiopia (2.8 per cent) and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (2.4 per cent) are the leading places of birth in Africa. • 21 per cent were born in the Caribbean and Bermuda (mostly Jamaica) (8.8 per cent) and Haiti (7.2 per cent),
respectively. • The Black population reports more than 300 different ethnic or cultural origins, with 25.6 per cent reporting more than one ethnic or cultural origin. The most commonly reported origins include African (15.7 per cent), Jamaican (13.0 per cent), Haitian (10.8 per cent) and Canadian (5.9 per cent).
