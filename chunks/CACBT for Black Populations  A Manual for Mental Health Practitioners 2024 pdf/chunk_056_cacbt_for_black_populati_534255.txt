The therapist may believe they are able to do this in a single session if the client has completed an intake assessment with someone else or if a referring health professional has already done standardized measurements or provided extensive assessment information. In these situations, the therapist may already have a lot of information from the client and others, and believe they can enter the session with a preliminary conceptualization to present and discuss with the client. However, in CA‐CBT, a two‐session process is recommended even if other sources have provided some information. Extending the preliminary phase over two sessions is an opportunity to gather more assessment information, while giving the therapist and the client more time to build a positive rapport and working alliance. 39
