CA-CBT for Black Populations: A Manual for Mental Health Practitioners
Handout 6—Thought Record
The therapist should complete this exercise in session with the client, and provide the client with a modified form or worksheet with fewer categories/columns to complete between sessions. For example, a sheet recording just the situation, the negative thoughts and the counter‐statements that were developed or planned for future use is still a good basis for discussion at the next session. In addition, several phone‐based thought record applications can be found in the Apple application store under the
Health and Fitness category (e.g., iCBT, eCBT Mood, Triple Column).
