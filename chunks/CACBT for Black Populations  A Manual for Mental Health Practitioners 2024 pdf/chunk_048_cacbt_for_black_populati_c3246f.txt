CACBT for Black Populations  A Manual for Mental Health Practitioners 2024 pdf
Before starting the assessment, tell the client you are about to have a conversation about what has been going on with them and how it is affecting various areas of their life. If the client is properly oriented to the process, they will understand that it is necessary to ask these questions and explore these areas to get the best possible picture of what is contributing to stress in their lives and what is available to promote health. The CA‐CBT assessment combines elements of a typical clinical interview with an ethnocultural interview aimed at exploring whether the client’s beliefs, values and practices might be implicated in the presenting problem and/or support the treatment process. The CA‐CBT assessment provides a good opportunity for the therapist to gather more information about culture‐specific definitions of the client’s problems and to consider how to integrate this information into the conceptualization of the client’s problems and their interventions. Make sure to gather information from the following areas:
Identity
• name, age, gender
• racial and ethnic background, languages spoken, acculturation – The therapist should explore the client’s experiences with racism and how that possibly impacts their mental health, their coping strategies and their overall well-being by asking questions like “Can you share how your experiences with racism have impacted your mental health?” or “How do you cope with racial stressors in your daily life?”
• religious and spiritual practices
