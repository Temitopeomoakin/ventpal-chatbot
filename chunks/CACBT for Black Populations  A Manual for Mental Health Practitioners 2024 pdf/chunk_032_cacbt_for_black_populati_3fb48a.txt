CA-CBT for Black Populations: A Manual for Mental Health Practitioners
• Build a culturally responsive therapeutic relationship using a broaching technique (i.e., a consistent and ongoing openness by the therapist to invite the client to discuss and explore issues of diversity to not only explore concerns, but also to discuss cultural concerns). For example, incorporate discussions of race and racism and their impact on mental health as a part of the psychoeducation component of CBT, and identify cultural strengths to cope with the client’s distress.
• Focus on empowerment goals such as affirming an individual’s cultural identity, consciousness-raising and claiming their voice in a system of oppression during the goal-setting phase.
• Offer culturally appropriate psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring and behavioural exercises focused on reducing the client’s symptoms of anxiety and depression.
