CA-CBT for Black Populations: A Manual for Mental Health Practitioners to do the recommended exercise. This will provide further information about their capacity to complete personal projects and may identify barriers and resources that will affect success with personal projects in the future. For clients from Black populations, it can be particularly valuable to try out a personal project exercise that focuses on decreasing physical discomfort (e.g., sleep hygiene, relaxation techniques, nutrition or physical exercise). Clients from these communities may have a heightened sensitivity to the physical aspects of depression and may value interventions that allow them to change how their bodies are feeling. Descriptive studies suggest that using culturally familiar techniques such as deep breathing exercises and guided imagery techniques can be useful (Lechner et al., 2012). If using audio visual resources as a part of personal projects, ensure that the resources resonate with the client in terms of the characters, tone and voice (Watson-Singleton et al., 2019). The therapist should explain that doing these exercises will increase the effectiveness of the therapy work. Other potential first assignments could include:
• reviewing the problem list with a trusted friend or confidante (skill development: mobilizing social support)
• asking someone else to take on a task that is making the client feel overwhelmed (skill development: assertiveness, self‐
care, mobilizing social support)
• protecting some downtime (skill development: assertiveness, relaxation), which will also prepare the client to allocate time for activities to promote mental health
• practising deep breathing exercises (skill development: relaxation)
• doing a short reading assignment (psychoeducation)
• doing something simple that the client has suggested to make the next week a little easier (self‐care). Assessment and Feedback: One Session or Two? In CA‐CBT for Black populations, the assessment and conceptualization processes are spread over at least two sessions, as opposed to the one session more common to other cognitive‐behavioural models.
