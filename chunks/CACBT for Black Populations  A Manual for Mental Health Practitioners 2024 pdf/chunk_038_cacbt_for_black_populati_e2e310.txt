Chapter II: Therapeutic considerations
During the development of the original manual (2011), English‐speaking Caribbean community members were consulted and reported that:
• high rates of stigma concerning mental illness in the community means that emotional problems or seeking help for emotional problems is not usually disclosed to friends or families
• withdrawal, anger, irritation and complaints about nerves and nervous problems, and feeling bad, pressured, low‐spirited and vexed are common indicators of emotional distress
• religion and/or spirituality tends to be highly valued and is often turned to as a resource for maintaining personal strength in times of distress and hardship. There are a number of factors that lead Black people to delay seeking help for mental health conditions. A major barrier is a lack of culturally competent care, leading to misdiagnoses and ineffective treatments that worsen mental health issues (Pederson, 2023). Misdiagnoses can erode trust in the healthcare system, making individuals more reluctant to seek help (Cénat, 2024; Boros, 2024). Additionally, Black people often do not see themselves reflected in the healthcare system,
increasing their hesitance to access services (Fante-Coleman, Wilson, Cameron, Coleman, Travers, 2022). Black adults also experience longer wait times for care due to a shortage of providers in their communities and financial barriers (Faber, Osman, &
Williams, 2023). Economic struggles disproportionately affect Black families, often pushing mental health care lower in priority which may result in the perception that these concerns are non-essential (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2020). Compounding these issues is the cultural stigma surrounding mental health within Black communities, which is rooted in historical and systemic racism (Mental
Health Commission of Canada, 2021). This stigma can lead individuals to perceive their mental health struggles as normal responses to situational hardship rather than legitimate health concerns.
