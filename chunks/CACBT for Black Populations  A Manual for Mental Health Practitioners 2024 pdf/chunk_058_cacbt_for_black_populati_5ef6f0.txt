The client can present with a long list of problems and experiences that may make it daunting to identify one core belief linked to them all. It is usually the case, however, that the presenting problems can be clustered together so it is possible to identify a set of mechanisms that accounts for several of them. At this point, the therapist is trying to establish a starting point for treatment—this may be modified later based on client feedback, new information or changes in the client’s psychological, social or environmental situation. A guideline for understanding the client’s main problems can be found in Appendix 2, Handout 1: Understanding the Problem. A structured problem list might also help the client define where they are having difficulties and where they would like to focus. The client can complete this list independently or with the therapist, in session or as a personal project. Encourage the client to decide which areas they would like to target during the treatment session. This problem list, or a less structured one developed with the therapist, should be revisited periodically throughout treatment to evaluate progress and revise goals. An example of a structured problem list can be found in Appendix 2, Handout 2: Problem List. 40
