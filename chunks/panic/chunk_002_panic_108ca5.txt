What are panic attacks?
How to recognise a panic attack
Fear and anxiety are normal emotions that most of us will experience from time to time. Sometimes that anxiety can be so intense that we experience a panic attack.
During a panic attack we may experience intense fear, terror and catastrophic thoughts that occur suddenly and often peak within 5-10 minutes.
Panic attacks are not dangerous but often leave us feeling like something awful might happen. If we have experienced a panic attack, we will want to avoid having another one and so may change our behaviour to prevent it happening again.
Reflect
When you panic, can you relate to feeling any of the following:
• “I feel like I’m going crazy, like I’m going to lose my mind”
• “My heart is racing so fast”
• “I can’t breathe”
• “I feel so dizzy and lightheaded, I feel like I might faint”
• “I get sweaty or have flashes of hot and cold that leave me clammy or cold”
• Do the feelings come out of the blue when you least expect them?
• Are you worried about these feelings coming back?
• Do you find these feelings stop you from doing things you want to do?
If you can relate to any of these feelings and are concerned about panic attacks, you may find the strategies in this workbook helpful.
