panic
Stress and hyperventilation
Why donâ€™t we always notice hyperventilating?
When we may think of hyperventilation, we imagine a person taking loud, rapid breaths;
however, it can also happen very slowly over a period of many hours.
If we take a big deep breath in every hour during the day, it could be that over many hours, we gradually take in more oxygen than our body needs.
However, imagine that after a busy day, you are on the way home and take a breath in, then start to notice these physical symptoms.
This feeling might be due to the imbalance between oxygen and carbon dioxide.
If you misinterpret these symptoms as a physical illness, you could cause yourself further stress and distress and this could lead to another panic attack.
