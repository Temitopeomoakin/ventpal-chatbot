Stress and hyperventilation
Why do we experience physical symptoms?
Overbreathing – or hyperventilation – means breathing faster or more deeply than your body needs.
The average adult will usually take around 15 breaths per minute when relaxed and not engaging in physical activity.
When we are under stress, our ‘flight or fight’ response is triggered and our breathing speeds up to inhale extra oxygen and prepare our body for action.
As we are not actually running away from danger, we do not use up this extra oxygen.
Because we’re inhaling more oxygen than our body needs, it causes an imbalance in our body’s chemistry.
When we acquire more oxygen than we need, it builds up in our blood stream over a period of time.
This build-up can happen gradually throughout the day while we’re doing our daily activities, without us realising.
This can lead to a variety of symptoms such dizziness,
feeling faint, numbness or tingling, breathlessness or tightness across the chest.
