Facing your fears
What would actually happen?
This graph shows what would actually happen if we were to face an anxiety provoking situation without the support of safety behaviours.
As you can see, anxiety goes up quickly when entering a feared situation, but with time (usually after approximately twenty minutes) will go down again.
With repeated exposure to the same feared situations, your anxiety will become progressively less severe and more tolerable. This process is known as ‘desensitisation’ or
‘habituation’, where the situation is so familiar that it no longer appears threatening.
To overcome anxiety, you will need to actively let go of your safety behaviours and confront the situations that you have been avoiding. The thought of letting go of your safety behaviours and avoidance may make you feel very anxious,
however by experiencing the anxiety provoking situation without the help of safety behaviours and facing the situation, you will begin to realise that you are able to cope with it.
