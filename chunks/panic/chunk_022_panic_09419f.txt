Graded exposure step by step
Step 1 – Plan your hierarchy
List all the things you are avoiding and rate how anxious or uncomfortable those situations make you feel on a scale of
0-100 (with 100 being maximum anxiety).
Add these to the graded hierarchy template on to make your graded hierarchy.
Start with the easiest or least anxiety provoking situations at the bottom, working up to the most anxiety provoking at the top.
Step 2 – Begin graded exposure
The next step is to start deliberately exposing yourself to the situations that you are avoiding.
Start with the easiest situation and keep repeating the same step until your anxiety has at least improved by 50%.
Make sure you follow the four rules of graded exposure from page 21.
Step 3 – Complete an exposure diary
Whilst completing your graded exposure, use the exposure diary on page 25 to record how you find it.
Step 4 – Review and continue
Keep working up the graded hierarchy recording your progress as you go.
