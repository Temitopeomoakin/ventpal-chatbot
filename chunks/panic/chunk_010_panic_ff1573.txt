What keeps panic attacks going?
Catastrophic misinterpretations
Symptoms of panic attacks are usually an exaggeration of the normal bodily reaction to a fearful situation.
As these symptoms can be very sudden, unpleasant and frightening, people often misinterpret the symptoms to mean that something catastrophic is happening. Common thoughts might be ‘I am having a heart attack’ or ‘I am going to pass out’.
The catastrophic misinterpretation is what drives the panic cycle. If you can recognise that the uncomfortable physical symptoms are not harmful, the vicious cycle is broken and the anxiety does not become a panic attack.
