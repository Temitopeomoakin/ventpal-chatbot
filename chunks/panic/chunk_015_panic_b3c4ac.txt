The vicious cycle of panic
How these factors can work together
We have talked about the role of catastrophic misinterpretation, selective attention and avoidance or safety behaviours. Now let’s look at how these things work together to create a vicious cycle of panic.
Example: Tim and transport
Tim had his first panic attack when he was on a busy train.
He started to experience palpitations and became dizzy and light-headed. He didn’t know what was happening and began to feel very scared. He thought that he might be having a heart attack and he thought he might die. Since this happened, he has been avoiding public transport. Over time he has started to avoid other situations too, such as busy supermarkets.
See Tim’s panic cycle on page 16 and then use page 17 to consider your panic cycle.
