What keeps panic attacks going?
Factors that keep panic attacks going
There are three main factors that can work together to keep panic attacks going
1. Selective attention – scanning your body for symptoms and sensations
2. Catastrophic misinterpretations – of bodily sensations and what might happen
3. Safety behaviours – using avoidance or other behaviours to help us cope
Selective attention
Research shows that those who experience panic attacks are much more likely to notice physical changes in their bodies,
such as an increase in heart rate or a change in temperature.
Reflect
If you look for a symptom, the chances are that you will probably find it.
Try the following experiment:
Sit for two minutes and scan your body. See if you can find any part of your body that is itching right now.
Did you find an itch? If yes, was that itch there before you looked for it?
The same applies to physical symptoms. If you search your body for the symptoms, you will find something even if there is nothing wrong. Finding a symptom will increase your anxiety and therefore increase your physical symptoms.
