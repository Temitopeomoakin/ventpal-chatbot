What keeps panic attacks going? Safety and avoidance behaviours
When a situation causes us anxiety, it is completely understandable that we would try to avoid that situation or adopt what is known as safety behaviours to help us to cope. Safety behaviours make us feel ‘safe’ in the anxietyprovoking situation. They are behaviours that we perceive as being helpful, as we feel that they make it less likely that something bad will happen. Avoidance and safety behaviours are helpful in the short term, but in the long term they maintain our anxiety. This is because we never have an opportunity to learn that nothing catastrophic will happen. We begin to believe that the only way we can cope with the situation is to use safety behaviours and we rely on our safety behaviours more and more. This reinforces the idea that our panic is dangerous and should be avoided. This keeps the vicious cycle of panic going. Examples of safety behaviours include:
