3.3 Behavioural Activation
From our experience, we have recognized that behavioural techniques are almost culture-free. We,
therefore, encourage therapists to use behavioural techniques before they try cognitive techniques.
In addition, it might be worth exploring the resources which a client doesn’t have, including money,
legal status, social connections (including isolation at home, especially for the elderly), necessities
(e.g., not being able to leave the house due to a lack of driving skills or access to transportation,
especially for the elderly and women) so the therapist can use these real-life examples to talk about problems and how to overcome them.
3.3.1 Self-Monitoring of Activities
Self-monitoring involves recording activities and associated moods for at least one week. In this way, we can get concrete evidence about clients’ levels of activity. It is common for clients to say that they are not doing anything, with some clients only realizing how much they are doing after they look at the record. The record also gives the therapist an idea of the client’s levels of activities. This can then serve as a baseline record that can be used for future comparisons. The therapist can ask the client to record the level of mastery and pleasure associated with each activity. The records can be used to test beliefs related to the client’s inability to do things. These records can also highlight any unhelpful coping strategies. Finally, the therapist can use the activities to remind the client of the thoughts and emotions that the client experienced. The therapist can then ask the client to increase activities that improve their sense of mastery or pleasure and reduce activities that cause distress. See Handouts 9 & 10.
