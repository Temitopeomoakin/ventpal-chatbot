Case Example #2
Bushra is a SA Muslim woman who worked as a schoolteacher. She presented with symptoms of anxiety and mild depression. She was living with her older sister for 6 months. She had left her husband because he was controlling, emotionally abusive towards her, and verbally abusive towards their children. After nine years of marriage, Bushra decided to leave their marital home after her husband’s latest outburst. She said she had left him in the past on two occasions, but family had intervened and she had to go back. However, positive changes in her husband’s behaviour following these past events were always short term. So she was determined to never go back to him. Bushra’s husband, on the other hand, was still contacting her, and this was a source of constant conflict and anxiety for her. The therapist initially focused on helping her with anxiety, low mood, and decision making. By the fourth session, she had decided to consider giving her husband a last chance if he fulfilled certain conditions, which included, joining her in therapy to address the domestic abuse. Soon after joint therapy started, it became obvious that Bushra’s husband felt it was his right and privilege to deal with his wife and family in this way (enacting cruelty upon them), and explained it as being allowed in Islam. The therapist talked to a local religious leader, who informed him that this is a misperception of the religious text and there is plenty of evidence to suggest that the reverse is the case. During the next session Bushra’s husband was given the homework assignment of writing the evidence for and against “treating his wife and children with cruelty” from Quran and Hadith (sayings of
Prophet Muhammad). The results were remarkable when the couple returned next time.
