CaCBT for South Asians manual ENG
A formulation based on the 5 Areas approach [57] can also be used from the start. When the client understands the CBT model during subsequent sessions, we share the model suggested by Beck [58]. Below is a case example to draw a few examples of formulation using a bio-psycho-social-spiritual model. Case Example #4
Mary is a high school teacher of SA origin working in the GTA and a Christian. Her husband is a successful businessman. She is a constant worrier. Like most SA families, she always worries about her children’s education, even though they are doing well and have good grades. She has perfectionistic tendencies and wants her children to be at the top of their class. For the last 6 months, she has been experiencing heart palpitations, sweaty palms, and pins and needles in her hands and feet. This started when her mom had a heart attack. She is also suffering from constant headaches and she has become irritable over small things. Mary experiences gas (bloating) in her stomach. She is tired all the time and cries over small things. She believes that she is suffering from a heart problem. She has gone to see a cardiologist along with her neighbor. The cardiologist said that Mary has no problems with her heart and is experiencing symptoms of anxiety and depression. Mary also feels guilty because she does not say her prayers regularly, is not seeing her parents who live nearby, and she feels that her mother does not pray for her because she is angry with her. She has experienced an episode of depression in the past and was worried she would become chronically depressed like her mother. She has isolated herself as she doesn’t feel like meeting anyone. See Figure 3 and the table below for Mary’s case formulation.
