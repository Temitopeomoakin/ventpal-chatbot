Steps in Problems Solving
1. Define the Problem
The first step is to make a list of possible problems. This can help in prioritizing the problems. The client can then decide which issue is the most important and should be dealt with first. 2. Decide which Problem is to Be Addressed First
It is preferable to choose a problem that appears easy to solve. An alternative approach is to solve the problem which is most important to the client. Our advice is to start with the first approach since that has the immediate effect of raising hope, which might be especially helpful when the client is depressed or has low self-esteem. Although the client should ultimately decide which problem is to be tackled first, a therapist can offer more active guidance during the initial stages of the problem-solving process. 3. Think About Possible Solutions
It is best to encourage clients to think of as many solutions as possible to their problem, a process akin to brainstorming. Encourage them to include solutions that you or the client think are possibly silly since this approach may bring forth ideas that the client may find helpful. It may be beneficial for the client to disassociate themselves from the problem for a short period. If the client finds it difficult to generate solutions initially, the therapist can help them to find solutions. 4. Look at the Cost and Benefit of Each Solution
Once a list of solutions has been formulated, it is necessary to go through them one by one,
to look at the advantages and disadvantages of each. To do this, ask them to draw a line on a piece of paper and write down the advantages and disadvantages of a solution on each side. You can then decide which solution is the best.
