CaCBT for South Asians manual ENG
The whole idea behind the above exercise is to find a balanced point of view. Once the client can look at the evidence, both for and against, they can have an expanded (or alternative) perspective.
Alternative or balanced thinking is often more positive than the initial automatic thought but is not merely substituting a positive thought for a negative thought. As one can see, this new alternative thought is different from being solely a positive thought.
Tip! Questions to Help Clients to
Think of Alternative Thoughts
A series of questions can help clients in thinking of alternative possibilities. These include:
3 What would my brother/sister/friend/spiritual or community leader think if they were in a similar situation?
3 What would I have thought if this had happened in the past, or when I was not so depressed/anxious?
3 What would I think if this happened a few months from now or when I am a little better?
3 If my friend was thinking like this, what would
I tell them?
3 Try to think of similar situations in the past, and what did you think then?
