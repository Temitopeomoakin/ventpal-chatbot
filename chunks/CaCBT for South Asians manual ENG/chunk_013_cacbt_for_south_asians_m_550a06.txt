Southampton Adaptation Framework to Culturally Adapt CBT
We developed the Southampton adaptation framework (see Table 1) to culturally adapt CBT [28]
using a mixed-methods approach (i.e., qualitative and quantitative data was collected). Our qualitative studies involved the exploration of experiences and opinions of patients, their carers, therapists,
mental health professionals working with them, and community leaders. For details of methods and the process of adaptation, please see references [13, 26, 33, 39, 40]. Information obtained from the aforementioned qualitative studies was used to culturally adapt a therapy manual using
CBT [41]. This methodology has been used to develop guidelines for cultural adaptation of CBT in
South Asia [35], the Middle East [29], North Africa [42], England [43], China [22] and Canada [44].
