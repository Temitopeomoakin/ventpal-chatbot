Improving Relationships – 1
Communication
Relationship problems can play a significant role in causing stress and tension. Relationship problems are caused by (a) communication problems, and (b) poor conflict management skills. There are four styles of communication that you need to understand:
Passive
Passive people usually don’t express their feelings. They don’t tell others what they want. They are unable to express their anger and bottle up their feelings.
Aggressive
Such people are aggressive, abusive, and demanding. They usually don’t care about the rights and needs of others. They attack, criticize, and degrade others. They are unhappy, which can affect the mood of others too. They are loud and rude.
Some people are a combination of passive and aggressive (i.e., they can be passive or aggressive depending on the situation).
Manipulative
These people know how to exploit other people’s weaknesses and get what they want by making others feel guilty. They play the victim card to abuse others.
Assertive
Assertive people tell others what they want and what they don’t want.
Assertive people are often less likely to suffer from depression, helplessness,
anger, and work-related or relationship problems. They are also healthier,
with a low risk of developing pains, ulcers, and high blood pressure.
How to be assertive
Try to keep calm with a pleasant and relaxed appearance. Maintain eye contact, but don’t stare. Adopt a relaxed posture. Don’t cross your arms on your chest.
