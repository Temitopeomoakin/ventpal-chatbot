1.1 Cultural Issues:
What to Consider
Before Therapy
The therapist’s first step in preparation for working with a patient from a different culture should be to conduct research before meeting the patient to explore one’s own biases, power, and privilege. For example, the therapist could talk to someone who identifies as being from a South Asian culture, or the therapist can look for culture-specific information in the research. In this manual, we will briefly describe some relevant areas of study. Please keep in mind that South Asian populations vary in cultural traditions, languages, religions, histories, and many other dimensions.
