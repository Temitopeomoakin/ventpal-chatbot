CaCBT for South Asians manual ENG
Ways to maintain engagement in therapy (p.42):
1. Using examples from therapy as evidence: Clients like to know how successful their therapist has been with other clients. Therefore, we recommend discussing similar cases and how the individual’s concerns benefited from therapy. 2. Describing current evidence from research can be helpful. 3. Creating a personal connection through similarities (for example: “Oh, I also have three kids.”)
4. Rejecting food or gifts from a client may be interpreted as rude and harm the therapeutic relationship. 5. Present coping strategies compatible with the client’s cultural/religious/spiritual background. Relaxation practices such as yoga, meditation, prayer, and extended head massage could be encouraged. Tools to convey a message to a client (p.44):
 Use stories, metaphors, and imagery (e.g., the blind men and the elephant story)
The two-stage rule: Focus and Connect (p.45)
 Stage one: Focus on the client’s concern.  Stage two: Connect the client’s problem to the clinical concern (e.g., anxiety, depression,
suicidal thoughts,) and share the plan. Ways to adapt the cognitive model (p.63):
 When addressing the cognitive model a few adjustments in terminology could be helpful:
• Explain a concept rather than using the term (Example: ‘cognitive error’ vs black and white thinking, ‘thoughts’ vs images a person has in their minds) and then, ask the client how they would name this concept. • Document physical symptoms in thought diaries to help clients see the link between physical symptoms and thoughts. Note: CA-CBT is flexible enough to allow techniques from other disciplines to be incorporated into it. We do not define CBT by its use of CBT techniques. It’s a psychotherapy that is based on the cognitive model. The important part is changing client’s thinking and behaviour so that they can make lasting improvements to mood and functioning. To do this, we can use techniques from many different modalities, as the need arises.
