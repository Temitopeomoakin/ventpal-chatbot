3 A clear idea (hypothesis) is selected that is testable.
3 Review the evidence for and against the hypothesis.
3 Break up the experiment into small steps if needed.
3 Ask the client to devise an experiment, write it down along with the possible outcomes and its meanings.
3 Probability of positive outcome by chance should be very small.
3 Results of the test should be clear, precise, and unambiguous.
3 Draw the conclusion.

Finding Alternative/Balanced Thoughts
The next step is to think of alternative thoughts or possibilities. Once the client has discovered that there is not much evidence in favour of their thought, they can be trained to think of alternative thoughts. Tell your clients that thereâ€™s usually more than one way of looking at a situation
(i.e., different angles of thoughts). Try to think of several alternative explanations.
