CaCBT for South Asians manual ENG
So, they make a specific statement which they can check. They then agree on an experiment and how to go about it. They set conditions. They also discuss the possible outcomes and interpretations. Most of the time, experiments involve other people, and therefore the therapist must be careful in devising and experimenting. It is essential to ask the client to describe the experiment’s outcome and discuss it with the therapist instead of his interpretation. Once the therapist and the client have discussed interpretations, they compare them with the client’s interpretations. Don’t try to test a belief system. The experiment can only test a behaviour or action, not a thought. See Figure 5. 72 | CaCBT for Canadians of South Asian Origin
