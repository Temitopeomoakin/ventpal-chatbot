CaCBT for South Asians manual ENG
Moreover, fear of reflected shame and loss of Izzat were regarded as key reasons South Asian women might not use mental health services. A central fear of South Asian women is the potential failure of mental health professionals to maintain confidentiality. South Asian communities operate within a highly patriarchal system, and therefore women and those from minority groups are more likely to experience the harmful effects of Izzat. For South
Asian women, it is well documented that they are considered to carry the Izzat of the family and therefore engaging in shameful behaviours perpetuates familial shame and stigma. South Asian cultures may have more expression of shame as opposed to guilt (more common in
Abrahamic religions such as Islam, Christianity and Judaism). Even when guilt is encountered, this may be in reference to violating a societal or familial norm. The Western-educated therapist may see this entirely as cognitive distortions but may need to understand the context of these emotions in a community affiliative cultural context/value. 56 | CaCBT for Canadians of South Asian Origin
