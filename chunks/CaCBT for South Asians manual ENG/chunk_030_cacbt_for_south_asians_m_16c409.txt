CaCBT for South Asians manual ENG
1.4 Shame and Guilt
Shame and guilt can be used to control unacceptable behaviours (e.g., use of alcohol or drugs,
intimate relationships outside of marriage, etc.) but also prevent help-seeking. It is important to note that South Asian communities and families experience what is termed ‘collective stigma’, where deviations from the cultural norm reflect less on the individual and more on the family [52].
For example, a client who reports that they are struggling with anxiety due to family pressure to get married by a certain age, or have a high-paying job in a specific field, may be experiencing collective stigma around a cultural norm. Other clients may report concerns from their family members about their chances of getting married if they are experiencing a mental health issue. This relates to the stigma around mental health and the emphasis on the biological/genetic causes of mental illness.
Exploring this might help improve follow-up in therapy and help the individual and their family work through relational issues.
