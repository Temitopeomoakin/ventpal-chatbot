Therapist Tipsheet: Involving
Family Members in CaCBT
Things to Do
Before bringing in family members:
 Find out who the decision-makers are in the family.  Consider that different degrees of acculturation may exist within the family.  Understand that family problems are connected to historical, intergenerational, cultural, and social power processes. Explore what values best serve the family. Are there any values that have been less helpful that family members would be willing to explore?  When working with female clients, offering to engage with the accompanying family member if the client is willing and approves.  Assess client safety before engaging with the family members.  Check with the client about bringing up any family issues or secrets.  Reiterate specifics of confidentiality to the client when involving a family member
• In the case of possible high conflict or vulnerable situations, such as concerns around
LGBTQ+ issues, agree beforehand with clients what would help them feel safe, what can and cannot be brought up within the family circle, and any other relevant cultural/generational factors that may impact the discussion. When family members are involved:
 Explore the client’s perceived place/role in the family.  Get an understanding of how family members perceive what is happening for the client.  Consider if faith leaders/healers may be included or referenced.  Provide psychoeducation on causes of mental illness and the purpose(s) of therapy.  Provide statements to the family to better support the client between sessions:
• “I know this is difficult for you. I am here to support you.”
• “Let’s review what your therapist has taught us.”
• “How about we write down this concern to discuss with your therapist next time?”
• “What would your therapist recommend in this moment?”
• “How has your anxiety been today?”
 Engage family in the client’s homework assignments.
