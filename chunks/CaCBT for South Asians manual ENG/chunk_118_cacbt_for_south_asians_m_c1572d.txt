If someone is injured, people can sympathize with him/her because a wound can be seen. When someone is experiencing depression, what is happening in their mind cannot be seen. Depression is an illness like other physical illnesses. It is not a sign of weakness, and it is not because of punishment for sins. When your loved one is experiencing depression, please consider the following facts:
 Someone experiencing depression cannot control their mood.
 Provide care and sympathy—listen to your loved ones carefully and try to empathize with them when they share their feelings.
 Individuals experiencing depression have a difficult time solving problems—even ones that may appear to be simple. Helping them to find solutions to their problems can ease their distress.
 Sitting and talking to your loved ones can help them to feel better.
 Encourage them to engage in activities they used to enjoy. However, remember that forcing them to do so can be harmful.
 Encourage an individual with depression to take their medication and psychotherapy as prescribed and visit their therapist on a regular basis.
 Healthy eating can improve mental health and wellbeing. Encourage your loved one to eat healthy food.
 Some individuals experiencing depression may begin to use alcohol or drugs to cope with their illness. However, this can increase depression.
 If your loved one is expressing suicidal thoughts, contact their mental health provider as soon as possible.
 You can support your loved one by encouraging them to read the material from their therapy sessions and to carry out the assigned homework assignments.
