CaCBT for South Asians manual ENG
3.1 General Advice
In this chapter, we have provided various details on specific adjustments to therapy that can be made in CaCBT. Furthermore, we have included considerations that should be kept in mind while working with South Asian clients.
3.1.1 Use of Images and Stories
Experienced therapists from non-Western European-North American cultural backgrounds often use stories to convey their message to clients. Stories can also be compelling when used with images in handouts [55, 64].
Case Example #5
Krishna presented with a persistent headache. He also had symptoms of both anxiety and depression and was referred for CBT. He expressed anger to his new
CBT therapist because his doctor was not initially interested in his headache and had not performed a physical examination. Therefore, the first two sessions with his new therapist focused on the assessment of the headache. The therapist eventually arranged for him to be examined by a physician. Krishna found this reassuring,
especially since the examination revealed no physical problems. He was then advised to use breathing exercises and muscle relaxation to help with the headache. Krishna asked whether a traditional South Asian head massage might be useful. The therapist agreed it would be a very good idea. When the client returned the next week, Krishna reported some reduction in his symptoms. The therapist started with educating him on anxiety and depression, describing his symptoms, and using his response to the relaxation exercises as evidence that his headache might be due to anxiety, and not a physical illness. Krishna was happy to proceed with therapy.
