1.5 Family-Related Issues
SA clients may live within an extended or joint family, which is not only an acceptable common practice but is also positively regarded within SA communities. Even when not living under the same roof, close ties are maintained within families. For the therapist, it is advisable to explore a client’s ties with their family. Therapists should assess family involvement in the client’s life and consider both the pros and cons of their involvement. Family involvement may become a detriment in instances where the client’s problems are a result of family stress, when family members want to know everything the client talks about in therapy (versus what the client wants them to know),
when there is fear that they may be criticized for the client’s illness, and when dealing with issues of shame, guilt, and stigma of mental illness in the family and its communal impact (including for prospects for marriage). Psychoeducation for the family members (e.g., providing materials, education, and other resources) is a vital part of therapy. Therapists should be aware that SA family members may not support the client participating in therapy by devaluing it, invalidating the client’s experience, telling them to ‘get over it’, or actively sabotaging the client’s efforts at getting well
(e.g., discouraging them from taking medication, completing homework assignments or attending therapy). As the therapist, you can also collaborate with your client on the best means to conduct therapy, where they can receive the privacy they need to have a session. This may require flexibility in scheduling by the therapist.
Get over it!
Stop taking those pills,
they don’t help.
Don’t disgrace the family!
