The Quran and Hadith
Muslims seek guidance from their holy book the Quran, the sayings of Muhammadpbuh, (called Ahadith –
singular Hadith) and other religious figures. Here are a few examples of quotes that Muslim therapists often use with their Muslim clients:
Surely Allah does not change the condition of a people until they change their own condition (Quran 13:11). O you who believe! If a liar comes to you with any news, verify it, lest you should harm people in ignorance,
and afterwards you become regretful for what you have done (Quran 49:6)
Deliberation is from Allah and haste is from the Satan (Hadith of Muhammad pbuh)
The believer reserves judgement until the matter is proven (Hasan al-Basri)
It is enough lying for a man to speak of everything that he hears (Hadith of Muhammadpbuh)
Surely by Allah’s remembrance are the hearts set at rest (Quran 13:28)
Be sure we shall test you with something of fear and hunger, some loss in goods or lives or the fruits, but give glad tidings to patient, who, when a calamity befalls them, say: surely, we are Allah’s and to him we shall surely return (Quran 155:156)
And He (Allah) dislikes gossip for you, asking too many questions, and wasting money (Hadith of Muhammadpbuh)
Worry is caused by thoughts, not circumstances (Caliph Ali)
For us, our deeds, and for you your deeds (Quran 28:55)
And we alternate such days between the people (Quran 3:140),
So indeed, hardship is followed by ease. Indeed, hardship is followed by ease (Quran 94:5-6). Make use of treatment, for God has not created an illness without appointing a remedy for it, with the exception of one illness, namely old age (Hadith of Muhammadpbuh)
A man asked: “O Messenger of Allah! Shall I tie it and rely (upon Allah), or leave it loose and rely(upon Allah)?”
He said: “Tie it and rely (upon Allah).” (Hadith of Muhammad pbuh)
* Note: pbuh refers to an abbreviation for “Peace be upon him,” a prayer stated after a Muslim mentions the name of Prophet Muhammad
