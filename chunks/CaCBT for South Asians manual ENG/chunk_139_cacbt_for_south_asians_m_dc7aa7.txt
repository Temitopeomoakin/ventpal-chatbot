Staying Well
Here are some things you can do to stay well:
Do one thing at a time
If you feel that you have lots of things to do, then make a list and prioritize the items.
Be mindful of your limitations
Learn to say, ‘I don’t know’, or ‘I cannot do it’.
Be aware of your strengths and weaknesses
Try to find out what makes you stressed.
Share your problems with your family and friends
Share your problems with others. Don’t try to face every problem on your own.
Improve your sleeping habits
Sleep affects mood because it is crucial for recovery from fatigue. Lack of sleep affects your health.
Take care of your diet
A balanced diet will keep your mind healthy too. Look after your diet. Try to reduce oily and spicy foods.
Regular exercise
Regular exercise improves your self-confidence & self-esteem and decreases stress, tension,
anxiety, & depression.
Balanced activities
Spend some time every week in activities that give you enjoyment and pleasure. This can be anything, like reading a book or magazine, go for a walk, and spend time with good friends.
Keep in touch with others
Spend time with positive, trustworthy, & loving people—it will decrease your level of stress,
improve your mood, & help you to feel better. Healthy relationships are one single factor that will help you throughout your life.
Keep your thoughts positive
Our thoughts make us, and people who are having positive thoughts (or balanced thoughts)
live a happy life.
