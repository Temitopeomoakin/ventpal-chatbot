Diversity in South Asian Groups
It is crucial to note that there is a great deal of diversity among South Asian populations. There are a variety of cultural traditions, languages, religions, histories, and many other dimensions that exist. As such, South Asia is one of the most linguistically diverse areas in the world with four language families that comprise more than 650 individual languages [7]. In India, Hindi is widely spoken and in the neighboring Pakistan, Urdu is widely spoken. Some states of India also using Urdu as these two languages are both commonly found to be spoken in the South
Asian region [8]. Bengali is the next most spoken language in South Asia and other notable languages include Telugu, Punjabi, Marathi, Tamil, Gujarati, Kannada, Pashto, Malayalam and Konkani. In Canada, the most spoken South Asian language is Punjabi, followed by Urdu, Hindi, Tamil, Gujrati,
and Bengali. Other SA languages spoken in Canada include Malayalam, Telugu, Nepali, Pashto,
Sinhala, Marathi, and Sindhi [9]. The major religions practiced in the South Asian region are Hinduism and Islam. Other religions that are comprised in the remaining South Asian population are; Buddhists, Jains, Christians, and
Sikhism. Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, Sikhs, and Christians are concentrated in India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bhutan, while Muslims are concentrated in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India and the
Maldives. South Asians in Canada tend to be significantly more religious than Canadians as a whole, with only 4% claiming to have no religion compared to 17% of the general population [10]. Additionally, 28% of Canadians of South Asian origin identify as Sikh, 28% as Hindu, and 22%
as Muslim. The Task of Providing Mental Health Care for South Asian Groups
