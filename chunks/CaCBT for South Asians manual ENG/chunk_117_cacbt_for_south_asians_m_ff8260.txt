What is Depression?
Depression is a common mental illness that affects how you feel, think, and act. A depressed mood can be a normal response to a loss (for example, grieving the loss of a loved one). However, it is called a depressive illness if the depressed mood lasts for more than two weeks and the individual feels sadness without reason or the severity of depression starts interfering with their daily routine.
1 in 20 people suffer from a depressive illness in their lifetime.
Symptoms of Depression
Sometimes people can experience physical symptoms such as headaches, gastric problems and other stomach-related pain, chest pain, and muscle tension due to depression. Depressed people may also lose their temper quickly. Other symptoms include feeling tired, memory problems,
trouble concentrating, inability to enjoy things and, in severe cases, suicidal thoughts. Depressed persons may also experience sleep and appetite problems.
Causes of Depression
The common causes of depression are:
 Chemical Imbalance
 Personality and Thinking Patterns
• Those who worry easily, who have poor coping skills, or who have perfectionist or obsessive personality traits
 Childhood Circumstances
• Negative or traumatic events
 Difficult Life Circumstances

Treatment of Depression
