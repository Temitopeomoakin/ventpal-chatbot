2.1.5 The Generation Effect
First-generation immigrants often adhere to values that belong to when they were growing up in their country of origin. These values may no longer apply now in their country of origin. Often literature and contemporary movies are valuable resources that outline this change, albeit dramatically.
However, there is no hard and fast rule in this area. The first author (FN) has noted that some immigrant families in the west might adhere to the cultural values of first-generation immigrants.
In contrast, their culture of origin might have changed and might have adopted Western EuropeanNorth American values. One expression of this is dress code (e.g., some South Asians prefer to dress like others in their country of origin when they move, while many young persons in South Asia wear clothing based on Western European-North American fashion). First-generation South Asians may adopt western norms in clothing and behaviour outside of the home. Inside the home, however,
they may continue to wear culturally congruent clothing and routines. On special occasions, such as weddings or festivals, traditional clothes will often be worn.
