What is Mood?
What is mood?
Mood is how we feel at a particular time. There are many different types of moods. Some of them are easily recognizable, while others are not. Some people find it difficult to separate one type of mood from another.
To understand your emotions, think about how you would feel in the following situations:
Event Emotion
You were just involved in an accident
Someone shouted at you for no reason
You just lost your job
While in bed, you hear a noise on the roof
You were caught trying to steal from a store
Your friend told you off for no reason
You have been offered a job
