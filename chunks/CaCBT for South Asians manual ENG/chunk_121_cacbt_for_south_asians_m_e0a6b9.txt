Unhelpful Ways of Thinking
Unhelpful Ways of Thinking
A specific life event (a change in circumstances, stressor, etc.) can sometimes trigger unhelpful ways of thinking, which in turn cause distressing physical sensations or emotions. These can also lead to changes in behaviours. What are unhelpful ways of thinking?  Jumping to Conclusions
Making an assumption with very little (or no) evidence to support it (e.g., you see your husband or wife talking to someone on the phone and you think s/he is having an affair).  Selective Abstraction
Focusing on a detail taken out of context, ignoring other more salient features of the situation, and you frame the whole experience on the basis of this fragment (e.g., you have the thought, “I am useless at my work” when your boss tells you that you are doing well, but need to improve your computer skills).  Overgeneralization
If it is true for one thing, it should be true for all things (e.g., “Because I failed one test, I am a total failure”, or, if you are late for work one day, you say to yourself, “I am always late”).  Magnification or minimization
Reducing the importance of positive information or expanding on negative information (the common phrase for this is—Making a mountain out of a molehill, or making a molehill out of a mountain!). An example is, you forget a name and blame yourself the whole day for being forgetful.  Personalization
You assume responsibility for everything that goes wrong, even when there is no evidence for it
(e.g., your colleague resigns from his job and you think “This is because I did not support him”)
 All or nothing thinking
Everything is seen as one extreme or another, good or bad, black and white, with no shades of grey (e.g., “If I don’t pass all my papers with 80% marks, I am a failure”, “If I don’t buy expensive clothes for my children, I am a useless father”)
Ask yourself, ‘What are my unhelpful ways of thinking?’
