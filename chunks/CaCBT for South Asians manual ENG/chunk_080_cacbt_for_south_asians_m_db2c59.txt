3.3.3 Graded Tasks
When complex activities are planned, it might be useful to break them into smaller steps. You should ask the client to start with small and simple steps. This is also called “success therapy” because it is assumed that the chance for future success increases if the client experiences success. In our experience, clients like this exercise and find it very easy, even when given at the start of therapy. However, you may wish to clarify that this is not the only thing the client has to do and you can continue to prepare them for cognitive therapy during this period to avoid premature termination. When clients cannot perform activities agreed upon in a session, they might feel more depressed. One significant advantage of the graded task technique is that it helps to reduce the chances of failure. Part 3 Therapy-Related Issues II | 59
