CaCBT for South Asians manual ENG
His father wanted everyone to live together under one roof and did not want him to leave. The therapist helped the client deal with the symptoms of anxiety, and further explored the client’s conflicting views about going to the big city. Assertiveness training failed since Anwar was not ready to try any techniques. He felt guilty because his father had told him that leaving the family home was against not only their religion, but also his family and cultural values, and would bring shame to his parents. The therapist worked on Anwar’s feelings of shame and guilt related to cultural and family values, before referring the young man to a local faith healer (the therapist had gained Anwar’s consent prior to this). Meeting with the faith healer was helpful in clarifying his misgivings: he was told that a person is allowed to express his opinion and disagree with his parents, so long as he is not rude to them. He was also told that he had duties as well as rights as a son. This gave him the courage to talk to his father. He was able to discuss the issue with his father and in the end they both agreed that it would be better for Anwar to move out. Part 1 Pre-Therapy Issues | 27
