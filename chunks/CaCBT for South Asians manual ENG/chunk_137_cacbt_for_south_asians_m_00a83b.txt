CaCBT for South Asians manual ENG
What about next week?’). Helpful techniques for different situations:
Broken Tape: Repeat your point of view gently. Don’t start an argument. For example, if you want to return an item to the shop, say, “I have decided that I don’t want it, so I want my money back.” After that, whatever the person says, you can repeatedly ask for your money back without getting into a debate. Fogging: You agree with some of the facts but stick to your decision. For example, your best friend insists that you should cut your hair short, but you don’t want to do this. You agree with whatever they say, but don’t agree to change your haircut. Cooling down: If someone gets angry during the conversation, you say, “You are angry now. I can understand your reaction. However, it is better to talk some other time when both of us are relaxed.”
