Challenging Unhelpful Thoughts
Challenging Unhelpful Thoughts
Once you have learned to recognize your thoughts and emotions, the stage is set for changing your thoughts. You will do this in two steps. In the first step, you will learn to challenge these thoughts. Please remember that it is difficult to change a thought, however, we can replace one thought with another. To do this, you should first try to weaken the unhelpful thought. This can be achieved by constantly challenging your unhelpful thoughts. Find the Evidence
The easiest way to challenge your thoughts is to look for evidence for and against your thought. Look at each thought in your diary and examine it. Imagine that you are a judge who must look at the evidence which is either for or against the thought to make a judgement whether this thought is realistic or not. At the end of this handout, you will find a second thought diary which includes two extra columns, in which you can write both the evidence for and against the thought. Some people find it difficult to initially find the evidence against their thoughts. Therefore, it might be helpful if you involve a friend or relative when you start this exercise. Similarly, some people ignore the evidence against their thoughts. After a little practice, you will become an expert in finding evidence for and against the thought. Of course, this is not an easy task. Some people can use their feelings as evidence for the thought, for example, ‘I feel so bad, I believe this is true. I am sure this is the case.’ But remember that evidence means solid evidence and not feelings or perceptions. Questions you can ask yourself to challenge your thoughts:
 What am I thinking?  Is this an unhelpful thought?
