CaCBT for South Asians manual ENG
Quick CaCBT Tips for
Practical Application
The first step in preparing to work with a patient from a different culture should be to complete research before meeting the patient (p.17). For instance:
 Talk to someone who identifies as being from a South-Asian* culture
 Look for culture-specific information in research
* Please note that the South Asian community is diverse, and each client will be different. Being open to learning about the culture from the client will ensure you do not make any cultural assumptions that do not apply to your specific client. Furthermore, it is not for the therapist to determine whether or not the client is South Asian. If the client identifies as being South Asian, then the client’s self-identification is enough. Their self-identification can be used as a cue for the therapist to apply CA-CBT. Self-Reflective Journaling (p.18)
Through journaling, the therapist can reflect and consider their:
 Cultural biases  Privileges
 Prejudices  Power dynamics
Rapport building (p.34)
Ways to build rapport with clients at the start of the therapeutic relationship may include:
 A Personal Touch: “Oh, you are from Brampton? My uncle lives there too.”
 Experience versus Evidence: “I have seen many people from your background with this problem and now they are living a healthy life.”
 A focus on symptoms that are concerning for the client. Exploring the client’s spirituality and its potential relationship to the problem (p.19)
Ask questions such as:
1. Are you a spiritual or religious person? 2. Can you please tell me about your beliefs? 3. How are your religion or spiritual values affecting your problem? 4. How does religion/spirituality come up in your life? Aligning coping skills with the client’s spiritual beliefs and cultural practices (p.19):
 Encourage clients to use spiritual and religious tools that have helped them in the past such as reciting prayers and reading texts that are important to them.
