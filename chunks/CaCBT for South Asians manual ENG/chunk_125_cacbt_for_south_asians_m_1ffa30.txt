Creating a Balanced Thought
Creating a Balanced Thought
Once you start examining the evidence for and against the thought, you weaken that thought.
Once you find more evidence against the thought than for it, you will realize that it’s not a realistic thought. As mentioned earlier, it’s difficult to control or change an unhelpful thought. However,
once you have learned to challenge the thought and find some evidence against it, you can create a new or balanced thought.
Finding alternative / balanced thoughts
The whole purpose of this exercise is to find an alternative thought. Once you have examined the thought you can create an alternative thought, which is also called a ‘balanced thought’. The next step is to think of alternative thoughts or possibilities. But this is not enough; you should try to remember this balanced thought. You can do this by writing it on a piece of paper and looking at it whenever you have an old unhelpful thought, or you can repeat it many times a day like a mantra.
Once you have created a balanced thought, you can act on it and see the results for yourself.
These questions will help you in creating an alternative thought
 What would my brother/sister/
friend think if they were in a similar situation?
 What would I have thought if this had happened to me in the past,
or when I was not so depressed/
anxious?
 What would I think if this happened a few months from now or when I am a little better?
 If my friend was thinking like this, what would I tell them?
 Try to think of similar situations in the past, and what you thought of at that time.
