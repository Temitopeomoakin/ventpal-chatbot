CaCBT for South Asians manual ENG
Another barrier is family and community stigma. There are South Asian clients who may be interested in therapy, but do not want to see a therapist from the same culture or ethnicity as themselves. Clients may fear the possibility of confidentiality being broken and their problems being shared within their community. This is where the therapist’s visible identity may initially help or hurt the client’s comfort with sharing information. The client may also be hesitant to share more than they feel they need to, as they may have grown up with the idea that problems stay at home. Therefore, building a good foundation of rapport can increase the confidence the client will have in the therapeutic process. Therapists should ensure to review confidentiality beyond the first session. If there is family stigma regarding the client’s participation in therapy, it can be beneficial to bring in a family member into a session and address the concerns they may have (if safe to do so). If this is not possible, ensure that the client is attending their sessions in a space that feels comfortable for them (if being done virtually), and further explore cultural upbringing and family history in session to increase knowledge on how to help with family conflict as a therapist. Therapists should keep in mind the importance of building a mutually respectful, authentic, and empathetic relationship with their client. Remembering that South Asian cultures are relationship-oriented, taking time to foster a warm and positive relationship, especially for those clients who are new to therapy, will help build and maintain the therapeutic alliance.
