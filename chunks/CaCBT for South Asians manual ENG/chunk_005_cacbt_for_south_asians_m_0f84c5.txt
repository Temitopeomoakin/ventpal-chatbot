CaCBT for South Asians manual ENG
What is CBT?
There is a famous fable in South Asia about six blind men who go to see an elephant. We often use this fable to introduce the basic concept of CBT to clients. According to the fable, the first man touched the side and said, “This is like a wall.” The second man touched a tusk and said, “This is like a spear.” The third man, who touched the trunk, said “This is like a big snake.” The fourth man touched the animal’s leg and said, “This is like a tree stump.” The fifth man touched the ear and said, “This is like a sheath of leather.”
And finally, when the sixth man touched the elephant’s tail he shouted “Ah! This is like a little furry mouse!”
They argued with each other for a long time about what an elephant looks like. They were all looking at the elephant using a particular perspective. We do this often in our lives as well. We may look at only one aspect of something, ignoring the full picture, and we don’t recognize that we can look at the same thing using different angles of views. A CBT therapist helps people to see things from more than one perspective.
