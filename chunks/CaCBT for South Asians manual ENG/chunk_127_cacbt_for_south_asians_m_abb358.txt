Activities and Wellbeing
How do our Activities
Affect our Mental
Health?
There is a deep link between our behaviour & emotions. Sometimes people with depression reduce their daily activities due to tiredness, low mood, lack of interest, and having little sense of enjoyment or achievement. Conversely, a reduction in daily activities can lead to an increase in depression. It is therefore important that this vicious cycle of reduced activity be broken.
The Balanced Activities
The first step towards wellness is to bring balance to your activities. You might find that increasing the amount of your pleasurable activities, such as watching TV or playing video games, helpful as a first step. By tracking your activities and your mood, you can discover how they affect one another.
Additionally, this diary can be used as a guide to see what changes in behaviour might help you feel better. Write your activity diary every day. Gradually add activities. Look at the four types of activities we recommend on the next page.
Go slow
Increase your activities gradually. When complex activities are planned, it might be useful to break them into small steps to keep the overall activity manageable. It would help if you started with small and simple steps—one by one—just like a ladder.
