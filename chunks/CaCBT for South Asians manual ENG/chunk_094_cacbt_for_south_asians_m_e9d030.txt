For example, when riding a bicycle or driving a car, you do not have to think about what to do next apart from being careful about traffic or what direction you are going. Similarly, we don’t realize how our thoughts guide our behaviours. Thoughts precede all our actions. For example, the thought “I am thirsty” comes before you go and get some water to drink. Similarly,
the thought “he insulted me” might have come to a person’s mind before hitting another person. People experience different types of moods because of their thoughts. When they are in a situation,
