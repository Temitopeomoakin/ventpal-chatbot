Improving Relationships – 2
Improving Relationships 2: Conflict management
Dealing with conflicts head-on can guarantee a healthy life. Successfully resolving conflicts also strengthens relationships. Here are some of the communication styles that cause conflict:
Extreme statements: “It must be done according to how I want it,” “He always misbehaves with me”, “He never agrees with me”, & “You are all the same”.
Fortune teller’s mistake: Trying to predict the future or believe you know for certain someone’s thoughts (e.g., “Whatever I do, he will never listen to me” & “She won’t agree with me because she doesn’t like me.”)
Emotional arguments: “I know he will do this”, or “You have a point, but I am not going to change my decision.”
Mixing positive with negative: You mix the positive with negative (e.g., saying to your wife “You are beautiful but you don’t know how to dress properly”).
Personal rules/principals: “Everyone should agree with me”, “They should respect me and obey my rules”
Instead, try these technique to manage conflicts better:
Agree to disagree: When you feel that the other person is stubborn, you can always say, “Let’s agree to disagree.”
Give & take: Conflicts can often be resolved with “give and take.” That is, by working together and coming to a compromise, conflicts can be resolved without problems.
There is a story of two goats who came upon a bridge and started arguing about who will cross first.
They begin to fight and both fell into the river. A little later, two wise goats, reached the bridge and,
realizing it was very narrow & only one goat can cross it at one time, one goat sat down and the other one jumped over him to cross the bridge safely.
