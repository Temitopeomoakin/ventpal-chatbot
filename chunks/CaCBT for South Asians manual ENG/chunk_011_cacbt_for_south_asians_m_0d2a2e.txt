CaCBT for South Asians manual ENG
CBT and Culture
Standard CBT contains as many culture-specific values as any other psychotherapy [24]. CBT involves the exploration of core beliefs and unhelpful patterns of thinking and attempts to modify them. People with depressive illness and anxiety usually have negative beliefs about self, others, and the unhelpful world. Such core beliefs, underlying assumptions, and even automatic thought content might vary with culture [25]. One study from India reported that 82% of psychology students felt that the principles of cognitive therapy conflicted with their values and beliefs [21]. Of these, 46% said that the therapy clashed with their cultural and family values, and 40% described a conflict with their religious beliefs. Another study explored whether the concepts underpinning CBT were consistent with the personal, family, sociocultural, and spiritual values of university students in Pakistan. Although there was little disagreement with CBT’s principles concerning personal values, some controversy existed regarding family, social, and, most importantly, religious values [26]. Qualitative interviews with mental health professionals in England [27], Pakistan [28], China [22], the Middle East [29], and Canada [4]
revealed the need for cultural adaptation of CBT for persons of non-Western European-North
American origin. What is Cultural Adaptation? Cultural adaptation of CBT has previously been defined as, ‘Making adjustments in how therapy is delivered through the acquisition of awareness, knowledge, and skills related to a given culture,
without compromising the theoretical underpinning of CBT’ [13]. However, our work has led us to revise this definition to the following: The cultural adaptation of CBT is the process of making adjustments in therapy to improve engagement when a provider works with a person with whom they do not share a cultural background. Some therapists in the USA have developed guidelines for the adaptation of psychosocial interventions based on their work with people from non-Western European-North American backgrounds and their subsequent observation that individuals from non-Western European-North
American cultures might have different sets of beliefs, values, and perceptions [30, 31, 32].
