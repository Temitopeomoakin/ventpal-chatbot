2.1.1 Information Gathering
In an initial assessment, detailed information about the client is gathered in a structured manner about different parts of their life and ongoing problems. The important aspects of the assessment are:
 Presenting problem(s): This includes details about the onset of the problem(s) and predisposing,
precipitating, perpetuating, and protective factors.  Identify the client’s goals in treatment. This is so that you can help them achieve these goals through CBT treatment.  Check for any previous episodes of anxiety or depression.  Gather information on any significant past or present substance use.  Check if they have had any past CBT therapy or counselling.  Check for any long-term physical conditions or present general health issues.  Check for ongoing stressors or persistent problems.  Assessment of risk factors to mental health.  Go through a specific situation (relevant to the client) in-depth using the CBT-based ‘5 Part
Model’ to help the therapist understand the underlying factors causing the current issues.  Explore bio-psycho-social-spiritual factors.  Ask about the client’s family history of depression or mental health problems.  Gather information about the client’s current occupation, level of functioning, social support,
social problems, and hobbies and interests.  Personality assessment is challenging in a single session. However, you can obtain some initial information through an enquiry about their reaction to stress and coping strategies, their usual mood, and how the person relates to others.  Ask about the family’s concerns.  Exploration of stigma, racism, and feelings of shame and guilt.  Assess their language and communication needs.  Explore their beliefs about health, ill-health, treatment providers, etc. Note: When possible, try to understand the family’s perspective on mental health (including causes and treatments and the family’s view on medication and therapy). This will ensure more positive outcomes in therapy.
