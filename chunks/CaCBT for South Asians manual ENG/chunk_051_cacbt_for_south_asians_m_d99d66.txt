CaCBT for South Asians manual ENG
After an initial discussion on setting rules and boundaries and gathering client consent, tactfully involving the family can improve engagement. The family can significantly assist in the process of information-gathering, the core therapy (by being
‘co-therapists’), supporting the client outside of therapy, and bringing the client back for follow-up each week. Valuable lessons in this area can be learned from culturally adapted family therapy [63]. Due to the hierarchical system typically present in SA families, there is usually one decision-maker in each family. The therapist should find out early in therapy who is the family’s decision-maker. Approaching the decision-maker can ensure co-operation and future follow-up. It is crucial to keep in mind the ‘secrets’ within the family. It is essential to maintain the client’s privacy, dignity, and confidentiality within this context. See Handout 4. 42 | CaCBT for Canadians of South Asian Origin
