CaCBT for South Asians manual ENG
In particular, the absence of mental health terminology in the South Asian languages referred to earlier. It is well known that terms for clinical depression, anxiety, and other psychological conditions, mental health expressions, phrases and words are often absent from
South Asian languages or not commonly used to describe the experiences of mental illness in this group. This can lead to a lack of awareness and understanding and can perpetuate stigma which may lead individuals to avoid seeking help [11, 12]. This project comes at a crucial time and turning point in mental health for the South Asian population. There is a gap in understanding the mental health experiences from a South Asian point of view,
complicated by care provision that does not meet the accurate assessment and needs of such a diverse group. Providers with such diverse groups require guidance that is evidence based, tailored and culturally appropriate for mental health services. This manual is a practical and important step forward in improving mental health outcomes for South Asians across Canada. We hope that it will decrease barriers to providing equitable, meaningful and accessible mental health care to South
Asian groups across Canada. | 5
