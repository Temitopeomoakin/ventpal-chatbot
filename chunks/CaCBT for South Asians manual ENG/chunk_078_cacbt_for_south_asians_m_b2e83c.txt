CaCBT for South Asians manual ENG
Notice that pleasurable activities do not need to be expensive. Activities can be either (a) those which give mastery and pleasure, (b) those that have been pleasurable in the past or, (c) new activities that the client and therapist feel are going to be helpful. When advised to complete an activity schedule, clients should be informed that they should not expect to find the activities as enjoyable or as satisfying as before they became depressed. As mentioned above, weekly activity records can help identify what a client was doing when they felt depressed, anxious, or angry. In addition to identifying behaviour and moods, the weekly activity schedule can be used as a guide to see what changes in behaviour might help them feel better. Helping clients in this area can help to increase their sense of mastery, control, and effectiveness. When a client has difficulty performing an activity, the therapist should discuss it in detail with the client and try to find out the obstacles that caused the hindrance. 58 | CaCBT for Canadians of South Asian Origin
