CaCBT for South Asians manual ENG
2.2 Engagement in Therapy
High rates of drop-out from therapy have been reported among clients from non-Western EuropeanNorth American cultures [39]. The following pointers might help to improve therapeutic engagement
(although a careful assessment of acculturation beforehand is still necessary).  The first few sessions are critical: Most South Asian clients expect immediate relief from troubling symptoms, so focusing on symptom management at the start of therapy can improve engagement and boost the client’s confidence in the therapist.  Pay attention to non-verbal cues: In most non-Western European-North American cultures,
therapists are seen in a position of authority. So, a client might not openly disagree with their therapist. Instead, they might express their disagreement by not turning up for the next appointment. Therapists should therefore pay attention to the client’s body language and subtle changes in language, expressions, and behaviours.  Use examples from therapy as evidence: Clients like to know how successful their therapist has been with other clients. Therefore, we recommend discussing similar cases and how the individual’s concerns benefitted from therapy. Also, describing current evidence from research can be helpful.  A personal connection: Clients from many non-Western European-North American cultures like a personal connection with their therapist. The use of religious, spiritual, or cultural examples can help. Offering food or gifts to a therapist is normal, and rejecting these might be considered rude. Personal disclosure about non-significant matters, mainly focusing on similarity and closeness, can help. For example, “Oh, I also have three kids,” “Yes, my mother lives in that area where you live,” or “Ah, my neighbours come from the same village where your parents came from.”
 Family is a valuable resource in therapy: Although the family can cause conflict and stress
(and even be a barrier to access or engagement with therapy), it can be a valuable resource to help and support clients.
