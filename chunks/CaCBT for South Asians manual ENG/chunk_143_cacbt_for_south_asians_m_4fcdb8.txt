CaCBT for South Asians manual ENG
The Name-it technique (p.26)
There will be occasions when you will not be able to find a suitable translation for a mental health-related term. In this case, you can provide a description of the concept in simple language and ask the client to name the concept, based on their understanding. If the client cannot think of a term, engage a family member or a community member, if possible. Techniques to recommend to clients when they wish to communicate their concerns with someone else:
1. The apology technique (p.27): Can be suggested to clients as a tool to replace more assertive and direct ways of approaching others. Start a sentence by using the following:
a. “I’m sorry, but if you allow me to disagree…”
b. “If you allow me to express myself…”
c. “I respect what you have to say, and if it is okay, I would like to say my opinion is...”
2. Triangulated approach to communicating with elders: Talking to one member of the family through another member of the family (example: talking to the father through the mother). Counting beads (p.46)
 Beads and counters are commonly used by South Asian individuals for repeating religious verses or words. Hence, they can be easily used to count thoughts. Questions for the therapist to reflect upon when considering client’s understanding of the cause of their situation (p.31):
 What does the client think I can do for them?  What are their limitations?  What are their strengths?  Do they think a psychiatrist or psychologist can treat their sadness?  What does the client think is helpful/hurtful OR healthy/not-healthy OR problematic/not problematic about the presenting issue? Questions to assess acculturation (p.40)
1. What language do you speak with your family and friends? 2. In which language do you think or dream?
