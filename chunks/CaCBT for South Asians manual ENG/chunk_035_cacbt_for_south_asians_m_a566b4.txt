CaCBT for South Asians manual ENG
Asking clients about their expectations about treatment is important. All the participants in our studies said they would benefit from “good investigations and quality medicines.” Educating a client on the side effects, indications, and limitations of medicines can increase confidence in a therapist’s abilities and engagement. South Asian clients often look for cures, and therefore, a discussion of expected outcomes should take place. It is crucial for the therapist to consider these questions: “What does the client think I can do for them? What are their limitations? What are their strengths? Do they think a psychiatrist or psychologist can treat their sadness?” The therapist needs to explore the client’s beliefs about ‘healing’,
underpinned by the client’s perception of etiology, attitudes towards treatment, and health-seeking behaviours. If the therapist is not aware and respectful of the client’s beliefs about healing, and their faith in other healing systems, they might risk offending the client. Part 1 Pre-Therapy Issues | 31
