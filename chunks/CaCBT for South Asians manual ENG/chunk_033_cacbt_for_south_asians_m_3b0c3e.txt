CaCBT for South Asians manual ENG

practitioners who use traditional medicines derived from ancient Greek or Chinese traditions,
homeopaths, or practitioners of Ayurvedic medicine), while those with only psychological manifestations will present themselves to faith healers or religious leaders [34]. 30 | CaCBT for Canadians of South Asian Origin
