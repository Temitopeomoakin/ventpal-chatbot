CaCBT for South Asians manual ENG
The Last Session
The last session gives you a chance to offer feedback (from both the client’s and therapist’s perspective), review the past sessions (if needed), and prepare the client for working independently. It is essential to highlight to clients that the end of therapy does not mean the end of practicing and learning. Unlike medication, therapy involves regular practice to master techniques. You can also tell the client that you (as the therapist) have taught them all of the fundamentals, and now they should go and practice what they have learned. See Handout 15. Here are the recommended steps that may help when ending the therapeutic process. 1. Review their overall progress and provide feedback
 Briefly summarize therapy content and review with the client their experience in the previous sessions. 2. Ask for the client’s feedback
 Take a non-judgmental approach and offer space for the client to express their feedback regarding yourself (the therapist) and their therapeutic experience. 3. Prepare for the future
 By now, you will have an idea of the client’s strengths and weaknesses and factors that may cause a relapse. It is best to discuss with the client about possible obstacles to wellness. In addition, this will be an excellent opportunity to engage the family or other supports in the client’s life. They can remind clients about helpful strategies and watch for the signs of relapse. 4. Discuss termination of therapy and resources they can use in the future
 Termination work should involve a frank discussion of progress made, areas that need more work, and information on resources for use in the future. From a CBT perspective,
growth occurs as individuals become more authentic, responsible, and accountable for how their experiences affect the functioning and well-being or themselves, other people around them, and their communities.
