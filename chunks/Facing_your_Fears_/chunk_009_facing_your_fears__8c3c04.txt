You’ve hopefully identified whatever is causing us to feel that whilst avoiding whatever is causing fear can bring relief in the short-term, a pattern fearful, we soon teach ourselves of avoidance prevents the fear from being reduced in the longer-term. A technique called that avoiding the source of our Exposure and Habituation will help you overcome your fear when faced with the source fear feels better than confronting of your phobia. This approach will support gradual exposure to the source of fear in a it. Avoidance brings us immediate manner that’s acceptable to you and help you identify what happens to your level of fear relief and can soon create a ‘pattern if you actually remain in the situation. What commonly happens when the situation is not of avoidance’. However, the next avoided is that the level of fear will naturally come down, a process called ‘habituation’. time we face the source of our phobia, our fear-related physical feelings quickly go up again and our ‘pattern of avoidance’ starts again.
