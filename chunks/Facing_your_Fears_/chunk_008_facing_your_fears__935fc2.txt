My Vicious Cycle Worksheet Breaking the Vicious Cycle
Before we try to get on top of your phobia, it’s worth spending a little time trying to understand how phobias develop and what keeps them going.
The Vicious Cycle of Fear and Avoidance
As we can see in Shay’s vicious cycle, when the dog was seen,
physical feelings quickly became overwhelming and the behavioural response was to escape the situation and get home. This is a type of behaviour called ‘avoidance’.
As we can see when the source of a phobia is avoided there will usually be a quick reduction in fear-related physical feelings and we start to feel better. Avoiding whatever is making us feel afraid may understandably feel the right thing to do.
