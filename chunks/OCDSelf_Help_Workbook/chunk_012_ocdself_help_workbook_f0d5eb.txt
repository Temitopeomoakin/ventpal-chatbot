This will be explained in thoughts of the fire, which may be caused if he left more detail. For example Jack becomes anxious every the appliance on. This increases his anxiety and to time he uses electrical equipment (triggers) and reduce this anxiety he checks the appliance but then when he leaves his home.

The checking and a fire occurs?” To relieve his anxiety he does lots relieves his anxiety for a brief period until he uses the of rituals (repeatedly checking the equipment) or he same or another electrical appliance. Thus, as can be avoids using the equipment. The rituals and avoidance seen in the diagram below a ‘vicious circle’ is formed relieve the anxiety but interfere in his life as he spends and it is this circle which maintains OCD.
