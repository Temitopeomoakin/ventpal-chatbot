Setting some goals
Now you understand how your obsessions,
Examples of a person’s compulsions, physical feelings, behaviours specific goals:
and thoughts fit together; you can use this knowledge to help you overcome OCD. • to go out with my family/friend once a week for
2 hours and enjoy the time I have with them
You already know how your OCD affects your life. You wrote this down a few pages • to do the family wash twice a week in 4 hours ago on the impact sheet. • to leave the house every day and leave a lamp on
Many people find it a really good idea to set themselves some goals to start their recovery. You • to take my children to the park and let them should base these goals around the areas where your play on the grass for 2 hours a week life is affected by your OCD. That way you can do something really positive to overcome the impact of
OCD. Remember, your facilitator will give you some advice here if you need it.
Goals in Detail
You are the person who can decide what you want out of your treatment. These will be your goals. Goals will help you to:
• keep focussed on your recovery
• be clear about what you want to achieve
• give you feedback on your progress
A goal is what you want to be able to do at the end of your programme. You should be as clear and as specific as you can. You may want ‘to feel better’ or
‘to stop OCD’ but ask yourself what ‘stopping OCD’
means you will be able to do.
