possibility and know what to do if this happens. It is important to remember that OCD does not come back immediately, it usually recurs gradually. If you become depressed you need to be extra vigilant of the early warning signs of OCD i.e. thoughts or small rituals starting to creep back in. Setbacks can usually be nipped in the bud and relapse can often be avoided.
It is useful (particularly for the first year) to monitor yourself to ensure no thoughts or rituals are beginning. For some people keeping a weekly diary of their progress is helpful. If you have a friend or partner who has helped/supported you through your treatment it is important that they are aware of the factors associated with relapse and to ask them to tell you if they notice any rituals (however small) starting.
Your facilitator will discuss keeping well with you and will help you to develop an individualised ‘staying well’
plan.
