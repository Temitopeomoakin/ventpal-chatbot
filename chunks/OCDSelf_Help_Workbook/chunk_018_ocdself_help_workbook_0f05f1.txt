Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) is has on your life. CBT is about working in partnership a ‘Psychological Therapy’ based on the with you and together looking at and trying the view that the way we act (behaviour) and best solutions. CBT is a broad term for a number of our thoughts (cognitions) and our physical interventions. One CBT treatment used particularly sensations (feelings) are all interlinked for OCD is exposure and response prevention.
Exposure and response prevention is recommended and change what we do. CBT helps to by the Department of Health as the best psychological identify the unhelpful and helpful feelings, therapy for treating OCD. Exposure means gradually behaviour and thinking that you have. facing your fear until anxiety falls. Response prevention means stopping the rituals. A way of thinking about this is that you will be gradually taking risks, but these risks are no different to the risks that people without OCD take. This will be explained in more detail by your facilitator. Write down in the space on the next page what you think would happen if you did not do your rituals or ask for reassurance.
