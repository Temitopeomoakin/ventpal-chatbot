Frequently asked questions
There are some common questions that coping statements people ask about exposure and response prevention and we have tried to answer them. If you want more details or have other questions ask your facilitator.
I don’t know how to cope with the level of anxiety when facing my fears?
This is common and there are a number of ways of coping with your anxiety. You may find it helpful to write some coping statements. These are statements that you say to yourself or write down on a piece of card. For example they may include things like:
“Anxiety is unpleasant but it won’t harm me”
“Although I feel anxious in the short term if I face it,
the fear will pass”
“The physical symptoms of anxiety are similar to those when I am excited; it is the worrying thoughts that make me feel afraid”.
“These feelings will pass”
“If I achieve this, it will be the beginning of a new life and new opportunities for me”
In the space to the right write down three coping statements that you think will be helpful to you.
