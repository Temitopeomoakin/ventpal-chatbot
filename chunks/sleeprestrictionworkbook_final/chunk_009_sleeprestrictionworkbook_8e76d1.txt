Improving your sleep
Step 2. Review sleep efficiency
Once you have completed your sleep diary,
your therapist will talk you through how to calculate your sleep efficiency.
We would recommend that you ask your therapist for a copy of the sleep efficiency spreadsheet so that you can continue to work out your sleep efficiency once your treatment has ended.
Sleep efficiency below 85%
If your therapist has determined your sleep efficiency is below 85%, they will suggest you continue to Step 3 on the next page.
Sleep efficiency above 85%
If your sleep efficiency is above 85%, we would consider your sleep to be efficient enough already and therefore your therapist will discuss with you whether sleep restriction is needed at this stage.
