Sleep hygiene
Top tips for bedtime
There are also things we can change around bedtime that may help you get a good night’s sleep.
• Establish a routine – go to bed at the same time each night and get up at the same time every morning, even if you feel tired or sleepy.
• Ensure the bedroom conditions are quiet, cool,
dark and comfortable.
• Try to avoid worrying about not getting enough sleep – trying to make yourself go to sleep just keeps you awake.
• Relax before going to bed. This could mean having a hot bath, listening to relaxing music,
having a hot milky drink (caffeine-free) or doing a relaxation exercise.
• If you have not managed to sleep after roughly 30 minutes, get up and go to a different room and do something quiet and un-stimulating until you feel sleepy.
• Avoid doing stimulating things before bed such as watching TV.
• Avoid looking at the clock while trying to sleep –
this will only make you worry.
• Don’t expect too much from your sleep – you may not need as much sleep as you think.
Reflect
Before you try sleep restriction, have you tried all the above? What still needs to be worked on?
