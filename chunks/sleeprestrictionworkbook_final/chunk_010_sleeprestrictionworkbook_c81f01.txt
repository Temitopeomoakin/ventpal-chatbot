Improving your sleep
Step 3. Decide on a sleep window
A ‘sleep window’ refers to the period of time we will allow for sleep during sleep restriction.
This is based on the average number of hours slept from your sleep diary (i.e. not the average time in bed).
John’s sleep window
• John’s average time in bed for the week of his sleep diary was 10 hours.
• John’s average time asleep however was six hours so this was set as his sleep window time.
• John decided to set his sleep window as 12am to 6am.
Key considerations
Whilst your sleep window time is set based on your sleep diary, there are a few things to consider when setting your sleep window timings.
• When do you start to feel tired?
• What time do you need to be up in the morning?
• What times is it light/dark outside (if this impacts you)?
In addition to the above:
• We recommend a minimum sleep window of five hours.
• Your sleep window should remain the same every night whilst in treatment. If you are a shift worker or have other concerns with this, please speak to your therapist.
• You should see your timings as the very earliest you can go to bed and the very latest you can wake up. Tired before your bedtime? You must wait until the bedtime starts.
Reached bedtime and not feeling sleepy? Only go to bed once you feel sleepy, but still wake up at the same time.
