Thoughts
How do our thoughts affect our sleep?
It is also important to consider how our thoughts can impact our sleep.
When we have had difficulties sleeping for a long period of time, we can get stuck in some negative thought cycles.
Here’s an example:
Thoughts
“If I don’t sleep well
“I will not be able to function tomorrow”
Physical
Emotions symptoms
Anxiety
Heart palpitations
Low mood
Feeling hot
Lack of concentration
Behaviours
Avoiding
Cancelling
Generally doing less
Worry
Reflect
