Sleep restriction
How do I improve my sleep with sleep restriction?
When trying to tackle problems with sleep, a useful tool is a sleep diary. This will give you a more realistic indication of how much sleep you are getting each night and what factors might be affecting this.
You may think that you are already aware of what is impacting your sleep and how much sleep you are having,
but this first step is a really important step that we encourage everyone to complete.
• Step 1 – Fill in a sleep diary
• Step 2 – Review sleep efficiency
• Step 3 – Decide on a sleep window
• Step 4 – Apply your sleep window, record your diary
We will work through the four steps within the next pages.
Even if we don’t usually find it helpful to write things down, this can be a form of avoidance.
We cannot fully tackle our sleep issues without being able to clearly, factually see how much sleep we are getting. Try to use the diary for at least three days and see how it goes.
