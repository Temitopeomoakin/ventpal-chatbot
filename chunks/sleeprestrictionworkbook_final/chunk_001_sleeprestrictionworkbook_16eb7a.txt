What is sleep restriction?
Introduction
Sleep restriction involves trying to get the number of hours that you spend in bed as near as possible to the number of hours you are actually sleep.
The aim of this workbook is to help you increase the amount of time spent not just in bed but asleep by:
• Improving the depth and continuity of your sleep
• Developing more synchronised sleep cycles
• And improving your association with your bed and sleeping
Is sleep restriction for me?
You can decide together with your practitioner whether this is something you feel would be beneficial for you.
Sleep restriction is a very strict process that you must stick to in order for it to be successful, which can be quite a commitment.
We recommend that you try the sleep hygiene workbook first, so that we can address any of these issues before we look at sleep restriction, as it may not always be needed for everyone.
