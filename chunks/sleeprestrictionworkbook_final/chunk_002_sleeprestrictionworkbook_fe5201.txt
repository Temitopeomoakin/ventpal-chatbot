The importance of association
Do you associate bed with sleep?
If we spend lots of time in bed not asleep – e.g wishing we were asleep or worrying that we are not asleep and how we might feel the next day –
then we start to associate our bed with those negative feelings of worry and frustration.
Our bed then becomes a place we start to dislike, which makes sleeping in it even harder because we start to dread going to bed.
We want to look forward to going to bed and associate it with the positive feelings of getting a good night’s sleep.
Therefore, the association between our bed and sleep plays an important role in how well we sleep.
How will restricting my sleep help me sleep?
You may wonder why we would want you to
‘restrict your sleep further’.
Our aim is to increase your drive for sleep by initially restricting the amount of time in bed and ensuring the time in bed is spent asleep – not doing anything else.
Reflection
Do you have a good association with your bed? If not think about what else you use your bed for and how you can ensure you only use it for sleep.
