Improving your sleep
Step 4. Apply your sleep window and record your sleep diary
Once your sleep window is established, work with that sleep window for one week – each night,
whilst remembering to keep sleep diaries.
After one week, or in the next session with your therapist, you will re-calculate your sleep efficiency and sleep window based on the latest sleep diary as below.
If your sleep efficiency is…
Below 80%
• Decrease your sleep window by 15 minutes.
• In John’s example he would decrease his 12am – 6am sleep window to either 12am – 5.45am or 12.15am – 6am.
80 – 85%
• Leave your sleep window the same and continue to keep a sleep diary.
86% +
• Increase your sleep window by 15 minutes.
• In John’s example he would either increase his 12am –
6am sleep window to 11.45pm – 6am or 12am – 6.15am.
Repeat steps 3-4 as necessary until you reach a sleep efficiency of 90% or feel that your sleep is now good and no longer an issue.
