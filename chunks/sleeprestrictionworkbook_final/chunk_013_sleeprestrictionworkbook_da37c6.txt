Myth busting
Everyone’s need for sleep is different.
The average adult sleep duration varies from 5-10 hours per night. It is also normal that as we age, we need less sleep and tend to expend less energy day-to-day.
It’s therefore normal for your sleep to be less than previous years and does not always mean it’s a problem.
