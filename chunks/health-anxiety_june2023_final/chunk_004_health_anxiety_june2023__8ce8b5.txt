When we experience health anxiety, we tend to spend a lot of time focusing on particular parts of our body, usually the area we are most concerned about.
For example, someone who might worry that they have mouth cancer, may spend a lot of time looking inside their mouth in the mirror or when doing other activities such brushing their teeth. When we’re so focused on one area of the body we’re going to notice every single sensation or change – most of which will be completely normal sensations or changes that your body makes every day.
