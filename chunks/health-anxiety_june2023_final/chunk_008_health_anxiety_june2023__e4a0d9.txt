Facing your fears
What would actually happen?
This graph shows what would actually happen if we were to face an anxiety-provoking situation without the support of unhelpful behaviours.
As you can see, anxiety goes up quickly when entering a feared situation, but with time (usually after approximately twenty minutes) will go down again. The very first time you do this your anxiety will be at its highest. However, the second time you face the feared situation you will find that your anxiety has reduced, and the third time your anxiety will be even lower.
With repeated exposure to the same feared situations,
your anxiety will become progressively less severe and more tolerable. This process is known as desensitisation or habituation, where the situation is so familiar that it no longer appears threatening.
