What are safety behaviours?
Avoidance can come in many forms. Sometimes we do not escape or avoid the situation entirely but instead we start to adopt unhelpful behaviours that help us to feel safer in that situation. These are called safety behaviours.
Some examples we see in health anxiety include:
• Going to the GP surgery very often for reassurance (or avoiding going at all)
• Googling symptoms
• Avoiding medical programmes or the news (or watching them to try and find those with a positive outcome)
• Reassurance seeking from friends and family
• Checking our body for changes and sensations
Safety behaviours can appear helpful in the short term. However they also maintain our anxiety. This is because we believe that the reason we’re able to get by is because of the safety behaviour. We miss out on the opportunity to learn that there was no threat or that we’re able to cope on our own if faced with a challenge.
Reflect
Can you relate to any of the above?

To overcome anxiety you will need to actively let go of your safety behaviours and confront the situations that you have been avoiding. The thought of letting go of these behaviours may make you feel very anxious. However by experiencing the anxietyprovoking situation without the help of these behaviours and facing the situation, you will begin to realise that you are able to cope with it.
