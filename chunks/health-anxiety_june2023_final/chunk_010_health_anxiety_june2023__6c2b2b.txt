Graded exposure
What is graded exposure?
Graded exposure is a technique that works by breaking down our feared situations and confronting them gradually.
Using a graded exposure hierarchy, we start with situations that are less anxiety provoking and work up to more difficult situations. This helps us learn that anxiety levels do come down if we stay in the situation and don’t use safety behaviours.
See a graded hierarchy example on page 14.
The four rules of graded exposure
• Rule 1 – Graded
Exposure to anxiety-provoking situations must be graded in order of least to most anxiety-provoking.
• Rule 2 – Prolonged
You need to ensure that your exposure to the situation is prolonged. This means that you need to stay in that situation until your anxiety has reduced by at least 50%.
• Rule 3 – Repeated
Repeat each exposure activity until your anxiety rating from the start of the exercise has reduced by 50%. Once you’ve achieved this, you can then move up to the next exercise on your hierarchy.
• Rule 4 – Without distraction
It’s important when using this technique to be aware of any safety behaviours that you are doing, or anything that could distract you from the anxiety. It’s important to truly feel the anxiety in order to learn that your anxiety levels will reduce. If it feels too difficult to drop safety behaviours initially, then you could start off by including them on the lower levels of your hierarchy and gradually removing them.
