What is health anxiety?
Anxiety is often considered as our response to a threatening situation.
We can have this response to a perceived threat as well as to as a physical threat in the here and now. This response is sometimes referred to as the ‘fight or flight’ response.
Health anxiety can include a fear of having a serious illness or the belief that you already have a serious illness.
We all worry about our health from time to time, for example if we had to go into hospital for an operation, or if we were to be called by our doctor following tests. Worrying about our health can even lead us to improve our lifestyle, for example, to give up smoking or to follow a healthy diet.
Health worries become a problem when they get in the way of normal life even if there is no clear evidence that anything is seriously wrong.
Examples:
• Fear that a physical symptom is due to a serious illness
• Worrying about your health to the point that it affects how you live your life
• Physical anxiety symptoms such as an increased heart rate or stomach upset
• Seeking reassurance from friends, family and health professionals
• Checking or scanning your body for symptoms
• Avoiding things that remind you of illness or that may make you ill
• Fear that your serious illness could not be cured by modern medicine
• Fear that being unwell would mean a loss of dignity and quality of life
