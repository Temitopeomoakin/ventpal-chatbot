What can trigger health anxiety?
The reasons you may struggle with health anxiety, may include:
Stress
Stress and anxiety are often linked as their physical responses are similar. When we’re already stressed or anxious, we instinctively become more aware of possible threats which can lead us to focus on potential threats to our health.
Extra responsibility (e.g. having your first child)
When we become responsible for something or someone other than ourselves, our anxiety can focus on what would happen if something were to happen to us e.g. What would happen to the children?
Someone you know suffering from serious illness
The more we’re exposed to something like illness or death, the more we can overestimate the likelihood of ourselves becoming ill as this then appears to be more common than it may actually be. This could be from someone you know having an illness or condition, or from learning about it on TV or radio.
Experiencing a serious illness or unexplained medical symptoms yourself
Health anxiety is not only for people who are ‘healthy’. Sometimes people with existing or undiagnosed illnesses can experience this too. Whether you are healthy or not is not the main difficulty with health anxiety, it is more about the extent to which we are pre-occupied with worry about this and what we do to try and manage these worries such as avoiding things or checking symptoms frequently.
