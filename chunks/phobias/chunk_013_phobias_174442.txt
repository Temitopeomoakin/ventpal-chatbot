phobias
Graded exposure:
step by step
• Step 1 – Plan your hierarchy
Make a list of situations you avoid, then rate how anxious or uncomfortable those situations make you feel on a scale of 0-100 (with 100 being maximum anxiety).
Add these to the graded hierarchy template on page 15 to make your graded hierarchy.
Start with the easiest or least anxiety provoking situations at the bottom, working up to the most anxiety provoking at the top.
• Step 2 – Begin graded exposure
The next step is to start deliberately exposing yourself to the situations that you are avoiding.
Start with the easiest situation and keep repeating the same step until your anxiety has at least improved by 50%.
Make sure you follow the four rules of graded exposure from page 12.
• Step 3 – Complete an exposure diary
Whilst completing your graded exposure, use the exposure diary on page 16 to record how you find it.
• Step 4 – Review and continue
Keep working up the graded hierarchy recording your progress as you go.
Exposing yourself to the phobia will be very anxiety provoking initially, but your practitioner will support you with the strategies throughout and over time your anxiety will start to reduce if you stick to the four conditions on page 12.
