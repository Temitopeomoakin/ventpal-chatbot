phobias
What is anxiety?
Anxiety occurs when we perceive a situation or object as threatening and we don’t feel we have the skills we need to cope with it.
If something causes us to feel afraid or scared, then this can induce physical symptoms known as the ‘fight or flight’ response.
This a response that has evolved to protect us from danger and includes symptoms such as increased heart rate,
feeling hot and feeling a surge of adrenaline, among others.
These physical symptoms occur to help us either run away from danger or to prepare to fight it.
The ‘fight or flight’ response is helpful if we are faced with real danger but for most of us our daily lives do not present us with life-threatening situations.
When we are faced with any situation that we don’t feel prepared to deal with, the ‘fight or flight’ response can become activated. If the situation is not physically threatening (e.g., giving a presentation to a large group of people) this response is not helpful for coping with the situation, and can actually be quite frightening.
