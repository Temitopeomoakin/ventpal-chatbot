phobias
The problem with avoidance
In the example on page 6, each time the person is faced with something related to dogs, the same cycle will occur, leading to continued avoidance or continued use of safety behaviours (see page
9 for more information on safety behaviours).
This means that their fear remains intact and their belief in their ability to cope doesn’t increase and instead these behaviours can maintain anxiety as illustrated below.
Increased scanning for threat or danger
Anxiety causing physical symptoms to intensify
Escape or avoidance
Short term relief but no opportunity to challenge anxiety related beliefs
Long term – fear and original belief in ability to cope remains the same,
leading to a loss of confidence and use of safety behaviours
