phobias
The vicious cycle of avoidance
If we have a phobia that causes us to feel anxiety or fear, it’s understandable that we will try to avoid it. In the short term, avoidance gives us relief from the unpleasant emotional and physical symptoms of anxiety. This is called negative reinforcement.
However, if we continue to avoid or leave situations that cause us to feel anxious, we will feel just as scared next time we are faced with the same situation, resulting in a vicious cycle of anxiety and avoidance.
By leaving or avoiding a situation that causes anxiety, we never learn whether we can cope with it and whether our fears about what might actually happen come true.
Typically, our phobia will result in specific thoughts or worries, emotions, physical symptoms and behaviours that we do to try and manage our fear. The example below is of someone with a phobia of dogs. This illustrates how a phobia can affect us in these different areas and how this can lead to a cycle of avoidance.
