phobias
What are safety behaviours? Avoidance can come in many forms. Sometimes we do not escape or avoid the situation entirely but instead we start to adopt behaviours that help us to feel safer in that situation. These are called safety behaviours. Examples
 Only going to certain places with someone you feel comfortable with
 Over preparing or over planning to try and make the situation more predictable
 Carrying anti-anxiety medication just in case you become anxious
 Holding onto something to prevent yourself from collapsing when you become anxious e.g. a chair
 Opening windows to make sure you get enough air
 Always being close to an exit e.g. sit nearest the door on a train
 Smoking a cigarette before entering an anxiety provoking situation
 Seeking reassurance or asking others to make decisions for you
 Distracting yourself e.g. listening to music or playing on your phone
 Using drugs or alcohol
Like avoidance, safety behaviours can appear helpful in the short term. However,
they also maintain our anxiety. This is because we believe that the reason we can get by is because of the safety behaviour. We miss out on the opportunity to learn that there was no threat or that we can cope on our own if faced with a challenge. We start to depend on safety behaviours and, if for any reason we are unable to use them, this may pose a significant problem for us. This can lead to feelings of hopelessness, worthlessness and negative thoughts such as “I’m pathetic” or “I should be able to cope with this – what’s wrong with me?”. This creates a vicious cycle that leads to us perceiving the world around us as being threatening and ourselves as being unable to cope, resulting in more avoidance or safety behaviours.
