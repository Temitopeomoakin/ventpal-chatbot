phobias
Why do we experience phobias?
Frightening experiences
In some cases, phobias may stem from a specific experience that may have been traumatic or had a negative meaning attached to it.
A common example is a child being confronted with a large dog that seems very frightening that may shock or surprise them. This could lead to a phobia as an adult.
However, not everyone develops phobias from frightening experiences such as these. Positive experiences with dogs after that event may prevent a phobia from developing.
Learning fears from others
For others, it could be due to other people’s perception of that object or situation.
For example, a fear of heights is a common phobia, and we may have spent a lot of time with someone who
‘taught’ us to be afraid without realising it.
In many instances the phobia may not have stemmed from either a frightening or ‘learnt’ experience and we may have no recollection of how we acquired it. It doesn’t matter whether we can remember the cause or not, the important thing is that we focus on the present and how to tackle our fears. We don’t need to know the cause of the phobia to recover from it.
Reflect
Can you think of anything that may have triggered your phobia in the first instance?
