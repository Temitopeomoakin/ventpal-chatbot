phobias
Facing your fears
What would actually happen?
This graph shows what would actually happen if we were to face an anxiety provoking situation without the support of safety behaviours.
As you can see, anxiety goes up quickly when entering a feared situation, but with time (usually after approximately
20 minutes) will go down again. We also have the opportunity to challenge anxious thoughts and predictions about what happens when we encounter our phobia.
With repeated exposure to the same feared situations, your anxiety will become progressively less severe and more tolerable. This process is known as ‘desensitisation’ or
‘habituation’, where the situation is so familiar that it no longer appears threatening. This is very effective for treating phobias.
