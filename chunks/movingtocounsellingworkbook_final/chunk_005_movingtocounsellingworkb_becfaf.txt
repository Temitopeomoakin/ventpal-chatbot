What now?
While you're waiting for counselling, you may find it helpful to access some of the self-help resources on page 9 or on our website.
You may have also been given some of our self-help workbooks. We have various workbooks including:
• Sleep hygiene
• Behaviours and low mood
• Worry
• Problem solving.
If you feel any of these would be helpful, speak to your
Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner.
You'll have the opportunity to receive a review call with one of our therapists to check on your wellbeing. We will be in touch with you via email to offer this.
