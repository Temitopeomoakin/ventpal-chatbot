What is counselling?
Introduction
Sometimes we need to explore issues which are painful and confusing, and donâ€™t feel able to talk about them with friends or family. Counselling offers a space where you can do this.
Why am I moving from a CBT approach to a counselling approach?
Both CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) and counselling have shown to be effective for a wide range of difficulties.
CBT is recommended for symptoms of anxiety and depression and offers tools to alleviate your symptoms.
Counselling at NHS Berkshire Talking Therapies is specifically recommended for depression. This approach is more explorative and allows you to explore and understand your depression symptoms.
