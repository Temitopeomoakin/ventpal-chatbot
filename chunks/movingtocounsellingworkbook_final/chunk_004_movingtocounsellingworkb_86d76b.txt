Getting the most out of counselling
Five top tips for your sessions
To get the most out of your counselling sessions we suggest you:
• Be committed to your counselling.
• Attend all sessions as planned and on time.
• Be honest, open and active within your sessions.
• Allow yourself sometime after your session to gather your thoughts.
• Spend time in between sessions reflecting on what was discussed.
The patient-counsellor working relationship
The counsellor comes to the therapy sessions with knowledge and tools to treat common mental health difficulties such as depression.
You come to therapy as the expert of your own difficulties that you are personally experiencing.
You and your therapist will then work together to understand your difficulties better, and to find tools that will work for you.
This process is a collaborative one, and both you and your therapist will be working towards the same goal.
For successful treatment, there has to be honesty and openness in the relationship. Your therapist will not have a hidden agenda and will be working with you to achieve your goals. Being honest about your problems will help you get the most that you can from treatment.
You will get the most out of treatment if you come to therapy with an open mind and a willingness to work on your emotions and to talk through issues.
