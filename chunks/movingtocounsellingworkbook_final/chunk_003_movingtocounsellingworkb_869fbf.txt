What to expect from counselling
Following your treatment planning session, you will be offered up to six sessions of counselling depending on the nature of your problem and what you wish to discuss with your counsellor.
Within your sessions the role of the counsellor is to facilitate rather than direct, this encourages empowerment and helps you to develop your own insight, clarity and selfunderstanding.
Each session will last about 50 minutes and usually take place at the same time and place weekly or fortnightly.
Sessions can be offered face-to-face, via telephone or by video consultation.
You will be sent weekly questionnaires to complete prior to your session. The questionnaires focus on your symptoms and help to identify problem areas, guide treatment and monitor progress.
Sessions will also involve regular reviews of any risk that may have been identified early in treatment to ensure your ongoing safety.
