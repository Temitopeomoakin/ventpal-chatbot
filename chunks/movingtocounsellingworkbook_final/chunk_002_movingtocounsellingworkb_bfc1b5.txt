What is counselling?
What kind of things can I talk about?
Everybody is different, however, some of the areas covered in counselling include:
• Loss
• Bereavement
• Loneliness
• Relationships
• Stress
• Self esteem
• Significant life events
Through exploring your difficulties with a counsellor, you may gain new understanding which can support you in finding your way forward and help you to feel better.
What happens next?
You will be offered a counselling treatment planning session which helps you and your counsellor understand what is important for you to focus on.
There may be a wait between your counselling treatment planning session and ongoing counselling; this will be explained to you at your first appointment.
