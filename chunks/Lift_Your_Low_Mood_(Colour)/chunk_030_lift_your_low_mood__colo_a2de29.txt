Lift Your Low Mood
CHECKING IN WITH HOW I’M DOING
As you come to the end of this workbook, it’s helpful to set a regular time to check in with how you’re doing. This can support you to notice Early Warning Signs and put your Staying
Well Toolkit into place as soon as possible.
CHECKING IN
I will check in with myself about the emotion that has been troubling me every
....................................... over the next ..................................... weeks/months.
Since completing this workbook:
Yes No
Have I started doing more or less of the activities I started to do again?
Am I experiencing any of the physical symptoms on my Early Warning Signs worksheet?
Am I having any of the unhelpful thoughts on my Early Warning Signs worksheet?
Am I struggling with my emotions again?
If I think low mood is returning, what could I do to help? Is there anything from my Staying Well Toolkit that may help?
Remember: We all experience low mood at times, and if your mood does drop it doesn’t necessarily mean you’re going back to where you were. It can just be a bump in the road.
However, if you find the bump in the road goes on for a while and your mood remains low, it may be helpful to go back through this workbook,
look at what you learnt last time that helped and try again.
