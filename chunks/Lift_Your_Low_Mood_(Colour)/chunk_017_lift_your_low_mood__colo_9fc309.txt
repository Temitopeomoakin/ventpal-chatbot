Lift Your Low Mood
STEP 2: IDENTIFYING ACTIVITIES
It’s time to start thinking about what you may have stopped doing or are doing less since you’ve been feeling low. You may also want to think about things you’d like to start doing for the first time.
When identifying activities, think about three main areas: Routine, Necessary and Pleasurable.
ROUTINE
These are thing you do regularly, often everyday things that help you feel comfortable. They can include things such as cooking, cleaning, shopping for food, or self-care.
NECESSARY
These are important and if not done can lead to negative consequences. These may also be less regular than routine activities. Examples include dealing with challenging situations,
paying bills or getting a prescription for a medical condition.
PLEASURABLE
These bring pleasure and can be things you value doing. They could be things you enjoyed before your low mood, but could also be new things you’d like to try for the first time. What you find pleasurable will be individual to you, but examples might include socialising, hobbies or helping at your local food bank.
Each type of activity provides us with something different, and therefore it’s important to have a balance in our lives. Routine activities provide structure, Necessary activities can lead to negative consequences if not done and Pleasurable activities are enjoyable or bring value.
Tip!
Include all activities that come to mind here, even if you think you can’t do them right now. We’ll consider this in the next step.
Looking back at the goals you set may help you think about activities to include here.
