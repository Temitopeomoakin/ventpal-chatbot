STEP 3: ORGANISING ACTIVITIES BY DIFFICULTY
Using the list of Routine, Pleasurable and Necessary activities you made in STEP 2, you’re now going to organise them based on how difficult they are to achieve. This will help you bring these activities back into your life. Rather than trying to do something too difficult too soon, starting with easier activities is the most helpful, before building up to more difficult ones when you’re able.
n Think about how difficult you believe each activity would be to complete in the next week n Write these down in the appropriate difficulty column
LEAST DIFFICULT
Activities you think you could manage in the next few weeks.
MEDIUM DIFFICULTY
Activities you would struggle to do in the next few weeks, but think you could just about manage if needed.
MOST DIFFICULT
Activities you believe are too difficult to complete at present, but you’d still like to work towards achieving them.
