Lift Your Low Mood
STEP 1: UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU’RE CURRENTLY DOING
To make changes to your behaviour, it may be helpful to first find out what you’re currently doing. This will help you identify activities you’ve stopped doing or reduced and see where there may be time in your week to add some activities back into your life. You may also find this helps you notice links between what you’re doing and your mood.
However, if you already have a good idea of the activities you’ve stopped doing and what your week currently looks like, you may consider moving to
STEP 2. Remember you’re in control!
If you think it would be helpful, use the blank Baseline Diary to record what you’re currently doing during the week. There are boxes for morning, afternoon and evening,
so try to record things you do in each of these, being as specific as possible. Using the three
‘W’s can help add detail.
“What” were you doing e.g. watching TV
“Where” you were doing it: e.g. in the lounge
“Who” were you with: e.g. on my own
At the end of each day, there is a Comments Box. You may find it helpful to complete this looking back over your day. At the end of the week, you, and anyone supporting you, may find it helpful to recognise any relationship between what you’re doing and your mood, thoughts and physical sensations.
You may notice your week doesn’t have many activities at the moment or you’re mainly doing the same things each day. This is common with low mood. But remember, this is just the starting point of how things are now and completing the diary will help you think about changes you can make to improve your low mood.
