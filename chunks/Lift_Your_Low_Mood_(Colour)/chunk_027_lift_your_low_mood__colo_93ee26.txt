IF YOU NEED FURTHER HELP
When you come to do planned activities, you may find them more difficult than you expected them to be. Don’t worry, this is common, especially if you haven’t done the activity in a while.
Make a note of this and then try considering the following tips.
n Selection: Look through each activity listed by Difficulty
– If an activity appears too difficult, are there any ways you can make specific tasks easier still?
– We’ve already discussed breaking tasks down – can they be broken down further if needed?
– Difficulty rating isn’t fixed, so you can always move the column an activity is in and consider it a hurdle to get over later on if it can’t be made easier n Adapting: Consider ways to do the activity differently
– Sometimes there are ways to adapt activities to improve our ability to do them
– At times there may not be a different way to do the activity, so we may need to recognise it as being in the Most Difficult category currently n Resource availability:
– Are there any resources available to you that can help make tasks easier to achieve?
– This will vary by person and by activity, but sometimes people may find that things such as family and friends, community or voluntary groups, other professionals or indeed a person supporting you to use this approach can help
