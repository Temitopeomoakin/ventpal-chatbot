Lift Your Low Mood

Activation does what it says on the tin. It breaks the vicious cycle by tackling the reduced activity and avoidance that can maintain low mood. As areas in the cycle are linked, a positive change in behaviour can have a positive influence on the other areas and improve your mood.

Going at a pace that suits you and engaging in activities that feel manageable provides you with an opportunity to improve your mood. Over time, you’ll get back to doing things you used to,
those you enjoy or value, were part of your daily routine or need to do. Or maybe you will want to start new things you’re interested in.
Behavioural Activation isn’t about throwing yourself back into everything at once. Starting with easier activities and doing little and often leads to the best results. If Behavioural Activation sounds interesting, why not read Sam’s story and give it a go.
