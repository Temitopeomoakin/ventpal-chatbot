Lift Your Low Mood
IS THIS WORKBOOK FOR YOU?
Low mood can be caused by many things such as biological factors or life events.
Sometimes it can be difficult to pinpoint a reason for why you’re feeling this way.
If your low mood is due to a specific problem that you’re finding hard to solve, for example financial issues like debt,
then it may be worth considering whether support with these areas may be beneficial.
