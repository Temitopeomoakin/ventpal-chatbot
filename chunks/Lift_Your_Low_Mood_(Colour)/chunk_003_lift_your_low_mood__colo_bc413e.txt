Lift Your Low Mood
WELCOME!
Well done, you’ve taken your first step to improve your low mood.
This workbook is based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT),
an evidence-based psychological therapy. It focuses on the hereand-now and helps people who are down, lack energy and have low motivation to understand the way they’re feeling and make changes to get back to their old self.
The workbook will guide you through a technique called
Behavioural Activation that has helped many people who have experienced low mood.
It’s designed to be worked through with the support of a mental health professional specifically trained to help you get the most out of this technique. Across England this will often be a Psychological
Wellbeing Practitioner (PWP) working within an Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) service.
You may have come across this workbook on your own, or it may have been suggested by a mental health professional supporting you to work through it. Either way, you’re in control of how you decide to use it.
