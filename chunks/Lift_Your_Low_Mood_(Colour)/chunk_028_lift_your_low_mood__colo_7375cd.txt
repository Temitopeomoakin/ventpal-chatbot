Lift Your Low Mood
STEP 6: MAINTAINING PROGRESS
Hopefully your hard work is paying off and you’re starting to notice your mood lifting little by little.
At this point, it can be easy to stop putting in the same effort towards making and maintaining the changes you’ve experienced. But if this happens, you, or friends and family, may start to notice your vicious cycle beginning to spiral downwards again. So, it’s important to ensure the approach used in this workbook becomes part of your daily life.
Simple steps can help you do this.
Revisit your Vicious Cycle completed earlier in the workbook and write the content of each area below.
