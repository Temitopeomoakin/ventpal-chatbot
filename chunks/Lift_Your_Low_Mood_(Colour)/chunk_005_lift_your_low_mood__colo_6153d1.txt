Lift Your Low Mood
UNDERSTANDING AVOIDANCE WITH DEPRESSION
When low in mood and experiencing a lack of energy and interest in doing things, it can be common to avoid things you used to enjoy or value. This can lead to a sense of relief. By doing less you feel less tired and irritated, and you don’t feel motivated to do them anyhow.
Whilst it’s understandable to avoid doing things,
the sense of relief it can bring is unhelpful.
Soon, however, our world begins to close in and we find ourselves not doing things we enjoyed, valued or indeed need to do. That’s when our mood begins to drop and can stay low,
leading us to become stuck in the vicious cycle of depression.
Cycle of Depression and reduced activity
You're emotionally 'down', increasingly
1 tired, have little motivation to do things and have negative thoughts
You start avoiding things you used to enjoy or value
2
3
Initially you feel a bit better and get a sense of relief from
4 not doing things
You do less and less and miss out on things you used to value and enjoy, things you need to do are stacking up,
and you struggle to keep up with day to day tasks
Your mood drops even more
5 and you experience greater relief from doing less and less
If this sounds familiar, don’t beat yourself up for falling into this cycle.
