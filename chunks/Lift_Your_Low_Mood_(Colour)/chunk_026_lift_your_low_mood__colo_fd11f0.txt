Lift Your Low Mood
STEP 5: GIVE IT A GO
Well done planning your diary.
As your mood’s been low, getting this far is a real success. Now you’re going to put your plan into place and do the activities you’ve written in your dairy at the times planned. This will help start you on the upwards spiral out of depression we discussed earlier.
With low mood, sometimes people can find it hard to get started giving their diary a go or not feel like doing the activities that they’re planned in. If this is the case for you, it’s understandable, just think back to your Vicious Cycle! However, it is important that we follow the plan we have made as much as possible, even if we don’t feel like doing the activity we’ve planned, as this will help to break this vicious cycle.
There can be two things that get in the way of people getting started, but there are ways to overcome these.
I can’t even get started!
You may be thinking you don’t have the motivation to start, maybe even with the Least Difficult activities. When our mood is low, our motivation drops as well, and that’s when the Vicious Cycle of Depression, starts. If you’re struggling, consider the tips on the following page.
I don’t have the motivation!
If we wait to feel motivated to do something, we can wait a long time! However, you may find your motivation slowly improves once you manage to overcome the motivation hurdle, and this will drive you to carry on and complete the activity. So, just making a start on the activity and overcoming that initial hurdle will get your momentum going to complete others coming up.
