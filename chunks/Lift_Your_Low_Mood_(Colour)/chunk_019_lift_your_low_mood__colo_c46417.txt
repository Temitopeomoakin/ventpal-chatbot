Lift Your Low Mood
STEP 2: ACTIVITIES WORKSHEET
ROUTINE NECESSARY PLEASURABLE e.g. cooking, wash dishes, e.g. booking medical e.g. socialising, hobbies,
food shopping, self-care appointments, talking to manager things you value at work, sort finances
Where you are unsure as to which category an activity fits in, just put it in the one you think fits best.
But I don’t enjoy things anymore!
When experiencing low mood, it’s common to lose enjoyment in things we used to love doing. Activities that were once pleasurable just don’t feel the same anymore. If you aren’t currently enjoying the activity but used to, it’s still helpful to write it down and as your mood improves over time you may start to notice you get the enjoyment back.
Once you’ve managed to identify activities under each column move to Step 3. If you’re having any difficulties, mention these to anyone that may be supporting you or family and friends.
