Lift Your Low Mood
WHAT DOES LOW MOOD LOOK LIKE?
When our mood is low, we may notice things such as not doing as much as we used to,
tiredness, poor concentration, unhelpful thoughts and maybe eating more or less than usual.
Experiencing things like this is perfectly normal when feeling down.
We all feel down from time to time!
However, when experienced for more than two weeks and we notice this beginning to impact our lives then it may be ‘depression’ setting in. Each of the things we’re struggling with can begin to have a negative effect on others, leading to a ‘vicious cycle of depression’.

Each of these areas has a knock-on effect on the others.
This can lead to people becoming stuck in the vicious cycle.
