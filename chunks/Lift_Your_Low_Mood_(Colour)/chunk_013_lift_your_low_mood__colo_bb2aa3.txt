Lift Your Low Mood
LET’S MAKE A START TO GET ON TOP OF YOUR LOW MOOD
This may feel daunting, but remember, go at your own pace. Sometimes progress will be slower than you’d like, or at times you may experience setbacks. This is common – when any of us make changes, we can experience bumps along the way.
To help break your vicious cycle of low mood, Behavioural Activation will take you through six steps to help you improve your mood.
STEP 1: IF HELPFUL, UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU’RE CURRENTLY DOING
STEP 2: IDENTIFY ACTIVITIES YOU’VE STOPPED DOING, REDUCED, OR
WOULD LIKE TO DO
STEP 3: ORGANISE ACTIVITIES BY HOW DIFFICULT THEY WOULD BE TO
DO NOW
STEP 4: PLAN ACTIVITIES BACK INTO YOUR WEEK
STEP 5: GIVE IT A GO
STEP 6: MAINTAIN PROGRESS
Remember:
If you’re being supported, make sure you discuss difficulties if you experience them.
