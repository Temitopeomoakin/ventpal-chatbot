STEP 4: PLANNING YOUR BEHAVIOURAL ACTIVATION DIARY
Using your list of activities organised by difficulty you’re now ready to start planning activities back into your week. It’s important to pre-plan your week and be specific with this, rather than decide at the time what you will do. This could lead you to fall back into your vicious cycle of low mood. Pre-planning using the diary over the page and trying to stick to this plan as much as possible will help with this. Here are a few tips that will support you to plan the diary in the most helpful way:
n Choose activities identified as Least Difficult or an urgent Necessary activity n Write each Least Difficult or urgent Necessary activity you need to do in the diary,
identifying the best day and time (Morning, Afternoon, Evening) to engage with it
– To see the best times to plan activities some people tell us they’ve found it helpful to block out times where they’ve had other things to do n When adding new activities, it can really help to be as specific as possible by providing detail on:
– ‘What’ you’re going to do: i.e. ‘Go for a walk’
– ‘Where’ you’re going to do it: i.e. ‘Park’
– ‘Who’ you’re going to do it with: i.e. ‘Alice’
n It is helpful to plan your week so that there is a mix of Routine, Pleasurable and Necessary activities, as these all provide something different but important for your wellbeing n As far as possible, spread out the activities you plan to do across the week
– Avoid ‘boom and bust’ by overloading yourself on a few specific days whilst leaving other days with no activities. n The number of activities you plan to do is up to you
– You know best what’s manageable for you, and it’s best to build them up over time at a rate that’s good for you.
