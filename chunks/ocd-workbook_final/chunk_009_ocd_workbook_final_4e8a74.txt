Facing your fears
What would actually happen?
However, when you face the situation without engaging in your compulsive behaviours, your anxiety will go up, reach a peak then go down again on its own.
The very first time you do this your anxiety will be at its highest. However, the second time you face the feared situation you will find that your anxiety has reduced and the third time your anxiety will be even lower. Each time you put yourself in your feared situation your anxiety will be progressively less severe and more tolerable (see graph below). This process is known as ‘habituation’ where the situation is so familiar that it no longer appears threatening.
As the anxiety fades, so does the urge to carry out the compulsive behaviours.
