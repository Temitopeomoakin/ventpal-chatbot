Obsessive Compulsive
Disorder (OCD)
What is OCD?
OCD is a common mental health condition in which a person can have obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviours.
What is an obsessive thought?
Obsessive thoughts are unwanted (intrusive), frequent and cause distress or anxiety.
The obsessions can be thoughts, images, impulses or urges and often contradict their values as a person. They are experienced by 98% of the population.
They only become a problem if they are interpreted in such a way that they seem threatening and so an action (or compulsion) is taken to prevent whatever is feared from happening. This can lead to the thought becoming stuck and very disturbing.
What is a compulsive behaviour?
A compulsive behaviour is something a person carries out to reduce the distress of the obsessive thought. This is sometimes also called ‘neutralising’.
Compulsions may be something that the person does that can be seen by others, e.g. washing or checking, or something they do internally, such as counting or repeating words. They are usually linked to the obsession and tend to make us feel better because we believe that they can influence or resolve the things that we are worried about happening.
However, the compulsion often has no real influence.
Compulsions are not normally enjoyable but bring about temporary relief from feelings of anxiety, tension and frustration which are associated with obsessions.
