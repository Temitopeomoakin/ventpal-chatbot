Types of OCD
There is common misconception that OCD is just about being excessively clean. However, this is not the case, there are actually many different types of OCD:
Cleaning – people with this type of OCD tend to pre-occupied with thoughts of germs in the environment and possible contamination. They cope by cleaning and washing excessively and avoiding places or situations that may result in contamination.
Checking – people with this obsession are pre-occupied with making sure everything is safe so that harm does not come to themselves or other people. To cope with this, they will check things repeatedly, just in case. For example, a person might repeatedly check that the cooker is off; for fear they will forget to turn it off one day and burn down the house.
Order and symmetry – people with this type of OCD want to make sure that everything is done in exactly the right way and in the right order. Objects must be put in exactly the right place. If this order is disturbed then they may get very agitated or upset, thinking there may be a bad consequence.
Hoarding –is when you keep all of your possessions and feel afraid to throw anything away, including small things such as old newspapers, used tickets and clothes that no longer fit. The underlying fear is that you might throw away something important or be wasteful.
Reflect
• People with OCD can participate in one, some, or all of these types depending on what they fear happening.
• Do you relate to any of these types of OCD?
