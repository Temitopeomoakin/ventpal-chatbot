Keeping it going
Top tips
Making changes to the way you think and behave can be very challenging and difficult and at first it is likely that it will take a while before you see a significant positive change.
It may be tempting to give up, but it is important to stick with it – it will get easier, and it will be worth it!
• When you feel yourself getting anxious again in the future or while carrying out compulsions - STOP! Take a moment to review your thoughts and behaviours and change them using the methods you have learnt. By catching it early you may be able to prevent it from becoming a big problem in your life.
• Look out for your trigger situations - if you know that a particular event or situation is likely to provoke negative thoughts or compulsions, think about how you are going to generate more helpful ways of behaving and thinking.
• Keep the list of common intrusive thoughts nearby -
so you can reflect on them when they happen.
• Resist the temptation to carry out compulsions -
stopping your compulsive activities is difficult initially and there may be times that you are unable to resist the urge to carry out your compulsive activity. If you find that you cannot resist the urge and you carry out your compulsive activity during an exercise, you can ‘undo’ the compulsion by exposing yourself to the fear again and restarting the exercise.
