The importance of changing compulsions
By carrying out compulsions, you are avoiding the anxiety caused by the obsessions.
Although in the short term this leads to a sense of relief, in the long term it makes the anxiety worse for several reasons:
1. The relief you get from carrying out the compulsions reinforces the belief that compulsions are the best way to deal with the anxiety associated with the obsessions.
2. They undermine your confidence in dealing with the situation in an alternative way. You may reinforce your belief that you are unable to cope with the anxiety unless you carry out the compulsion.
3. You are not giving yourself the opportunity to test our your beliefs and see if they are actually true.
Reflect
A woman walks down the road and sees a man waving his arms around in the air.
“Why are you doing that?” she says. “To keep away the dragons”, said the man. “But there aren’t any dragons”, said the woman. The man replies, “That just shows how well it works”.
