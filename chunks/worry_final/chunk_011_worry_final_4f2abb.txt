Attention training
When we worry, our attention is usually focused on the future and thinking about what could happen.
Even though our body is in the present, our mind is normally somewhere else and therefore we miss out on what’s happening here and now.
The following tasks will help you learn how to retrain your attention when you’re worrying so that you can redirect your attention to the present moment.
It is not an attempt to control your thoughts or make them go away, it is about allowing these thoughts to be present in your mind and at the same time choosing to shift your attention back to the present moment.
5 Senses
Another way we can move our attention is to focus on ‘external’ factors rather than ‘internal’ factors.
An internal factor is something that happens within us; a physical feeling or a thought. An external factor is something that happens outside of us; the world and people around us.
A simple way to move our attention to focus on external factors is by using our senses. If you find it difficult to bring your attention back to the activity you’re doing you can try the following which can act as a buffer to help really focus your attention and bring you back to the task at hand and to the external factors.
