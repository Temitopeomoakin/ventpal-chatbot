Managing hypothetical worries
Worry time
When you find yourself worrying about hypothetical worries, a useful technique that many people have found effective is “worry time”. Worry time is giving yourself permission to worry but at a time that you choose and are more in control of during the day. This is not to get rid of worry altogether but to reduce the impact that it has. We know with general anxiety, we can find that our worry themes can shift over time, so worry time tackles the process of worrying. This technique has four steps and like any new skill, requires practice. Step 1 – Plan your worry time
Plan a time for yourself to worry each day. This should be a period of between 15 and
30 minutes and can be helpful to be the same time every day. Whatever time works for you is fine as long as it’s set aside just for you to worry and you don’t do anything else during this time. Step 2 – Write down your hypothetical worries
When you notice you are worrying outside of your planned worry time, notice if it is a hypothetical or a practical worry. If it is hypothetical, write it down in your worry diary knowing that you can come back to it in your worry time. Step 3 – Refocus on the present
Once you have written down your worry, the next step is to refocus on the present. This means paying attention to what you were doing before you were worrying,
what is going on around you and the task at hand. This can be a hard skill to learn, the next few pages will give you details on how to practice moving your attention to the present after worrying. Step 4 – Worry
When it’s your planned worry time, worry!
