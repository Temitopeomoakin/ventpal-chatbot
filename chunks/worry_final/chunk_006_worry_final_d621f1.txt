Types of worry
Practical vs hypothetical worries
There are two types of worry that we will be looking at in this workbook. Difficulties can arise when we try to deal with all our worries in the same way so it’s important to be able to tell the difference between these two types. 1. Practical worries
These worries centre on real life, current problems that need to be solved. For example, if you were made redundant at work you may worry about finding another job. With a practical worry we are often trying to solve the problem by worrying about it, running through different scenarios and strategies in our minds in the hope of finding a solution. For it to be classified as a practical worry, it would have to be something we can do something about right now, either making a plan of action or completing the plan. 2. Hypothetical worries
This is when we worry about events that may never happen and which we have no control or influence over. For example, you may have heard a rumour in the office about possible redundancies in the workplace and begin to worry excessively that you will lose your job. This may set off a chain of further worries, for example: “What if I lose my job, and then I can’t find another job, and then I don’t have money to pay the mortgage, and then I lose my house, and then…” This chain can be very difficult to stop once it gains momentum, leaving you feeling anxious, nervous and tense. Reflect
• What do you worry about? • Are your worries practical or hypothetical? Worries can change between practical and hypothetical depending on the situation. For example, if your worry was “What if I don’t reply to that email?” and you’re not able to access your emails, it is a hypothetical worry.
