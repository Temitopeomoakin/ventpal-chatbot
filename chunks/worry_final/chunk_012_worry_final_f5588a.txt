Task within a task
Usually, we are doing something before a worry comes into our head such as relaxing, working, reading, talking to a friend. Once a worry has come into our head it is really hard to go back to focusing on what we were doing beforehand. The task within a task technique helps us bring our attention back to what we were doing before the worry appeared by creating a small task to tackle first. Step 1: Look at what you were doing before you noticed the worry. Step 2: Count something or take extra notice of something in that task (e.g. if reading,
count all the words beginning with the letter ‘A’). Step 3: After you’ve completed that smaller task, go back to doing the original task. Mundane task focussing
Think of your attention as a muscle, if you don’t exercise it regularly it will become weak and not work as well. We need to strengthen our attention by giving it regular exercise and practice. When doing household chores such as washing up and hoovering, you may have noticed that your mind is rarely focused on the task but actually tendsto wander. Therefore, these types of tasks are great opportunities to strengthen our attention muscle! With mundane task focusing, the goal is to gradually practice sustaining your attention on a mundane activity to give your attention a good workout. You don’t have to do anything extra in your day to practice this, just use the mundane tasks you already have to complete in your day but change how you pay attention to it. Begin the task without intentionally trying to move your attention. As you carry out the task,
try to really bring your attention to what you are doing. Using the following prompts may help:
Reflect
• Sight: What do you see while doing the task?
