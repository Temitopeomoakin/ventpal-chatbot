Managing practical worries
Problem solving
When we worry, our problems can sometimes feel overwhelming, like there are no solutions and we end up with practical worries. Problem solving helps you initially distance yourself from your worries to help you think about different types of practical solutions. This is something that we can usually do more naturally, but when we are feeling overwhelmed it is much more difficult to think in a creative way. This process can help us to think about all the possible solutions if there are any. Problem solving has seven steps to follow:
Step 1 – Convert your worry into a practical problem
When you identify a practical worry, change it into a problem to solve. For example, the worry “I still haven’t paid the gas bill” should be converted into a practical problem that can be solved such as “I need to sort the overdue gas bill by Thursday”. Step 2 – Brainstorm solutions
You should then try to identify as many potential solutions as possible. At this stage nothing should be rejected, no matter how ridiculous some solutions may seem. In fact, the ridiculous ones can help to generate other more practical solutions. You can use the next page or write this out on paper depending how many solutions you can come up with and what’s easiest for you. Step 3 – Consider advantages and disadvantages
Think about each potential solution that you came up with. What are its advantages and disadvantages? This may include the possibility of being able to undertake the solution, the resources you have to undertake the solution and how you feel about carrying it out. You can also use the worksheet on page 16 to record your work. Step 4 – Choose a solution
Rate your solutions using the final column considering the advantages and disadvantages you have noted.
