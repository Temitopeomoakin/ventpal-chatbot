Worry
Role of uncertainty
Think about the types of things that you worry about. Would you be worried if they were completely certain? The answer is probably no.
Worrying tends to be about future events, for which certainty is impossible. Worrying is a reaction to uncertainty, people who worry a lot tend to have a low tolerance of uncertainty. Even a small amount of uncertainty can cause worry.
Intolerance of uncertainty
The inability to tolerate uncertainty is an attitude many people have towards life where uncertainty, unpredictability and doubt are seen as awful, unbearable experiences that should be avoided at all costs.
With this attitude, you may perceive worrying to be useful as you think worrying is a way to prepare for the worst case scenario and a way of attempting to predict life so there are no surprises. As such, worrying reduces your feelings of uncertainty and you will continue worrying.
Reflect
• Has your worrying made anything more certain or predictable?
• Does worrying change the outcome of what will happen?
• Does the ‘false’ sense of security justify all the negative consequences of worrying?
It is only your perception that you somehow have more control by worrying.
•
If this is something you relate to and would like more details on managing uncertainty, speak with your therapist for further resources.
