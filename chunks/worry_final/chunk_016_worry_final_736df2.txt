Problem solving continued…
Step 5 – Develop a plan
The solution you have chosen may require careful planning. It’s a good idea to think about the steps you will take and anything you may need. Try to keep your steps specific and realistic. Use page 17 to jot down your plan.
Step 6 – Put your plan into action
Now that you have developed your plan, it is all about putting it into action.
Step 7 – Review your plan
Review how well your plan worked. Maybe it worked a little or maybe not at all. The advantage of problem solving is that other options always exist. If the plan worked well, continue to apply it.
If you get stuck, consider the following:
1. Think about what someone else might do? What advice would someone you admire give you to resolve the problem?
2. Combine ideas or modify them to come up with new solutions
3. Take a break! If you reach a block, go away from the task and come back with a fresh outlook.
