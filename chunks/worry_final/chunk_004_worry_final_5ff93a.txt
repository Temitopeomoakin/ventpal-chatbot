Identifying worries
Worry diary
Before we’re able to take control over our worries, we need to be able to identify them as they happen.
Try and record your worries as thoughts that go through your mind, for example, “What if the bus is late and I miss my meeting?”
You can record these directly into the worry diary sheet on the next page, jot them down in a notebook or on your phone. Choose the way of recording them that suits you, just as long as you’re recording it.
The worry diary on the next page shows the headings you could be using to record these worries.
As well as writing down your worries, you can record how anxious the worry makes you feel on a scale from
0-10. This will help identify which worries are the strongest and could be more important to focus on.
Many people find they worry more at night which interrupts their sleeping. If this is you, consider keeping your worry diary and a pen next to your bed.
