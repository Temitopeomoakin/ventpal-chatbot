worry_final
Just take this time to freely worry about all those hypothetical worries and accept these fears. You could go through your list of hypothetical worries and for each one, consider how you felt when you wrote it and how you feel about it now. Has the thing you were worrying about happened? How did you deal with it? Were there any worries that are no longer a problem? It is important that at the end of your worry time you stop worrying. Make sure you are starting a new list of worries each day. Some people find it helpful to throw away their list after their worry time that day. 10
