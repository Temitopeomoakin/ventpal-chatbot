Worry
What is worry?
Everyone experiences worry from time to time, usually when dealing with difficult or uncertain situations.
However, some people worry so much that it begins to affect their wellbeing and can cause chronic stress or anxiety.
Worry can be defined as a type of self-talk in which we predict that negative events will happen in the future and over-estimate the possibility of disaster.
Worrying thoughts tend to be characterised by “What if?” statements, for example: “What if my train is delayed?”
This is usually followed by imagined situations in which we try to plan how we would cope with these events if they were to happen. Often this involves over-estimating the likelihood or severity of negative events and underestimating our own ability to cope,
should the event occur.
