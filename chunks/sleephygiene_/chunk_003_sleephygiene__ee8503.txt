Sleep hygiene
Top tips for the daytime
There may be things that you can consider changing within your day that could help you get a better night’s rest.
• Avoid daytime sleep
• Exercise– aim to exercise during the day
(preferably outdoors) and avoid exercise late at night as it stimulates endorphins that may keep you awake
• Limit use of stimulants such as caffeine and nicotine before bed – caffeine can take up to six hours to leave your system
• Avoid using your bed for other activities other than sleep or sexual activity e.g. reading, smoking,
listening to the radio, watching TV
• Appetite – avoid going to bed too hungry or too full.
