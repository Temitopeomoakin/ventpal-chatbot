Improving your sleep
Step 2. Review and reflect
Once you have filled out your sleep diary, it can be helpful to consider what might be contributing to your sleep problems.
Consider the questions below and then fill in the table on page 11.
Reflect:
• Am I going to bed at the same time each night and getting up at the same time each morning?
• Am I drinking too many caffeinated drinks during the day, especially in the evening?
• Do I get less sleep, or poorer quality sleep, on nights when I have had an alcoholic drink?
• Am I taking any medication or drugs that might affect my sleep?
• Do I find it more difficult to sleep at night when I have had a nap during the day?
• Am I spending too much time in bed?
• Do I really need as much sleep as I think I do?
• Looking at the tips for a good night sleep (on page 5) – is there anything else that I can be doing differently?
If your thoughts and worries are interfering with your sleep… speak to your therapist as you may need additional support and techniques which you can use to address this.
