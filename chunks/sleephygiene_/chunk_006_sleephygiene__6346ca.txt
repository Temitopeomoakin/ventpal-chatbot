Improving your sleep
Step 1. Fill in your sleep diary for one week
When trying to tackle problems with sleep, a useful tool is a sleep diary. This will give you a more realistic indication of how much sleep you are getting each night and what factors might be affecting this.
Using the diary on page 9, record your sleep for one week.
It’s helpful to include:
• Naps within the day
• Any stimulants you’ve had e.g. tea, coffee, alcohol
• Worries you notice.
