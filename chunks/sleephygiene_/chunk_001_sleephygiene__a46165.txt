Sleep problems
Introduction
Most people will have difficulties with sleep at some point in their lives.
These might include difficulties getting to sleep, waking during the night or waking early in the morning unable to get back to sleep.
There are many things that can disrupt our sleep, see some examples below.
• Stress, worry, anxiety or depression
• Change in sleeping patterns (jet lag, shift work)
• Environmental factors (noise, light, temperature)
• Life events (bereavement, having children)
• Physical ill-health
• Medication, street drugs (amphetamines,
ecstasy or cocaine) or legal drugs (alcohol,
caffeine or tobacco) or withdrawal from any of these.
For most people sleep difficulties are temporary and will pass with time.
However for some it can last longer and start to affect areas of life including work, physical health and relationships.
