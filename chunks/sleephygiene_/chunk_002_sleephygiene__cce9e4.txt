Sleep myth busting
How much sleep do we need?
Often when we are experiencing sleep difficulties we may:
• Think that we have had less sleep than we actually have
• Think that we need more sleep than we really do
• Worry about the amount of sleep we have had
• Worry about the effect that the lack of sleep will have on us.
Worrying about sleep may make the difficulties worse.
Many people think that everyone should get eight hours sleep per night.
The truth is that everyone is different. Some people might need eight hours a night to function properly, but others may be able to get by on as little as four hours.
The amount of sleep we need also changes throughout our lives and as we get older we do not tend to need as much sleep.
