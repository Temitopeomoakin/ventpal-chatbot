[therapy_type: CBT] [subtype: Avoidance Cycle] [source: anxious-behaviours_final.txt]

The vicious cycle
of avoidance
If we find that a situation causes us to feel anxiety or fear, it’s
understandable that we will try to avoid it. In the short term, avoidance
gives us relief from the unpleasant emotional and physical symptoms of
anxiety. This is called negative reinforcement.
However, if we continue to avoid or leave situations that cause us to feel anxious, we will feel
just as scared next time we are faced with the same situation, resulting in a vicious cycle of
anxiety and avoidance.
By leaving or avoiding a situation that causes anxiety, we never learn whether we can cope
with it and whether our fears about what might actually happen really do come true.
