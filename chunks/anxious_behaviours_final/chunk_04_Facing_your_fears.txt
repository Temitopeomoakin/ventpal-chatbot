Facing your fears
What do you think would happen?
What would happen to your anxiety if you face
a feared situation and stay in it without using
any safety behaviours?
Most people would say that they wouldn’t be able to cope.
The anxiety would just keep rising until eventually
something terrible happens such as passing out or having a
heart attack. We know this is in fact not the case.
This graph shows what happens when we face an anxiety
provoking situation and our response is to leave or use a
safety behaviour. Each time we face that same situation our
anxiety is equally high the next time round:

Facing your fears
What would actually happen?
This graph shows what would actually happen
if we were to face an anxiety provoking
situation without the support of safety
behaviours.
As you can see, anxiety goes up quickly when entering a
feared situation, but with time (usually after approximately
twenty minutes) will go down again.
With repeated exposure to the same feared situations, your
anxiety will become progressively less severe and more
tolerable. This process is known as ‘desensitisation’ or
‘habituation’, where the situation is so familiar that it no
longer appears threatening.
