The example below is of Lynda, who experiences anxiety when going to the shops.
She notices her heart pounding, breathing difficulties and feeling hot. She thinks “I’m having a heart attack,” which further contributes to her physical symptoms. As a result,
she is now avoiding going to the shops, or escaping from them as quickly as she can.
This can cause Lynda to feel even more anxious when next faced with this situation and will also strengthen her unhelpful thoughts. Her thoughts, physical symptoms and behaviours are all influenced by each other.
Lynda’s ABC
Situation: Going to the shops
Autonomic
Heart pounding, difficulty breathing, hot and pains in chest
Cognitions Behaviours
“I’m having a heart Escapes from the Shops or attack” avoids going altogether
With low mood, people tend to think about themselves, the world and the future in a very negative way. For example, someone may think “I am useless” and “It is pointless trying, as there is no point”. The lower a person feels, the more NATs they will have. Naturally, the more NATs, the lower a person will feel. This forms a vicious circle that needs to be broken.
Look at the example below of Mike. Mike has been having problems at work and over the last few months has been feeling very low. As a result, Mike has been withdrawn and not spending as much time with others, especially his family. He recently received a phone call from his mum, who Mike thought was not being sympathetic. This left
Mike thinking ‘No-one cares about me’. Again, notice how his thoughts, behaviours and physical sensations are all influenced by each other.
