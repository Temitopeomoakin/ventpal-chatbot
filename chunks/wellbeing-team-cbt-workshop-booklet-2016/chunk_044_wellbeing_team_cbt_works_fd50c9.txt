How will behavioural activation help me?
Planning and sticking to activities will increase my motivation to do more and break the vicious cycle of depression.
Barriers or blocks and possible solutions
Barriers or Blocks Solutions
I don’t feel motivated Go with the plan not the mood
Keep going, the enjoyment will come
I didn’t enjoy it back
Everything seems to difficult Start small and build up
I just can’t do it Use support
I didn’t do something I’d planned Re-schedule, don’t be hard on yourself
