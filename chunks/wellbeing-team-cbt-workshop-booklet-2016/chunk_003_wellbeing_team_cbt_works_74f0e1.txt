Introduction
The Wellbeing Service offers support for people who are experiencing difficulties with depression, low mood, anxiety, worry, stress or panic. This workbook has been designed to be used whilst attending one of our Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)
Skills workshops or with support from your Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner (PWP).
Low mood, anxiety, worry, stress and panic can affect many people at different times in their lives. It may be a one-off occurrence or may reoccur on several occasions. It can be a very frightening, unbearable and lonely experience. It can feel as if it will never get any better. It may have taken some time to realise that you are struggling with your mood.
The aim of this workbook is to introduce you to a number of tools that will help you build up your own ‘toolkit’ to help manage your current symptoms of depression or anxiety and maintain progress towards long-term recovery. The tools covered in this workbook are based on the principles of evidence based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.
CBT looks at how your thoughts, physical feelings, emotions and behaviours are all interlinked and have an impact on each other. CBT uses practical strategies to help you make changes which are more positive and realistic. It is very important for you to put these strategies into practice as the more you put in, the more you get out of CBT.
You will notice as you read through the workbook that there are a number of exercises for you to complete. Try and work through these activities spending more time on those that seem more useful to you and your current problems. Speak with your PWP if you experience any difficulties with the techniques.
