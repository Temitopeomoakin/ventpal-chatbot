Healthy Eating
Everyone should aim to have a healthy and balanced diet. There are many advantages to healthy eating, including a reduced risk of obesity, heart disease and diabetes. Many of us consume more calories than we need to. If we are consuming more calories than we burn we are likely to put on weight. The amount of calories we need to consume depends on how active we are. The average adult male needs around 2,500 calories per day and the average adult female needs around 2,000 per day. In order to have a balanced diet it’s important to eat a wide variety of foods so that you are receiving all the nutrients you need. Check out below, some tips which can help you achieve a healthy, balanced diet. Don’t skip Breakfast
It is often stated that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and it’s understandable why! Eating breakfast can help with weight control and is an important part of a balanced diet. Wholemeal cereal is often recommended (with sliced fruit) as a nutritious start to the day. Five portions of Fruit and Vegetables
At least five portions of fruit and vegetables are recommended each day. Things such as unsweetened fruit juice and vegetables cooked into meals also count. Consider having fruit in the morning with your breakfast or some fruit for a healthier snack option. Eat more fish

Oily fish (such as salmon, mackerel, sardines and fresh tuna) have omega-3 fats can help to prevent heart disease, so try to include this at least once a week.
