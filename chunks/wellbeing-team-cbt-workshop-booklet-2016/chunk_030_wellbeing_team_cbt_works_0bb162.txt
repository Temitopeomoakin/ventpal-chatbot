Try not to have over 6g of salt each day. Be active
Regular physical activity can be helpful in trying to lose, or maintain healthy weight. You can achieve regular activity through regular exercise, or utilising other ways of incorporating regular activity. This includes making sure that if you find yourself sedentary for long periods of the day, try making sure you are active when possible. This could be using the stairs instead of taking the lift, or parking your car further away than usual and walking to your destination. CBT Skills Training Book 26 Wellbeing Services
