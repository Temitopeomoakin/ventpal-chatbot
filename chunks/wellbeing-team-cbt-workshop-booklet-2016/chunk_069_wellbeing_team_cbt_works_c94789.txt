In order to help you catch your thoughts, ask yourself the following sorts of questions:
What were you doing? What were you telling yourself?
Who were you with? What does it say about you if it’s true?
Where were you? What is the worst thing that went through your mind?
Some points to bear in mind when you are trying to catch your NATs:
• They are short and specific
• They occur extremely quickly after the event
• They can occur as words or images
• They seem reasonable at the time
• They do not arise from careful thought or in a logical series of steps
Step Two: Looking for the Evidence
After catching your NATs, the next stage is to challenge the ‘Hot Thought’.
• Write down the evidence for and against the hot thought
You are looking just for facts not opinions.
Think of this a little like being a prosecution and defence counsel in a court hearing.
Evidence will be given from both sides to find the truth.
To help you when you are looking for evidence, you might want to ask questions such as:
• If my friend or someone else was having this type of thought, what would I say to them?
• If I wasn’t anxious or low, how would I look at the situation?
• Is there any other way of looking at the situation?
• What is certain about this situation?
• If I believe this thought to be 80% true, what is the 20% that suggests I don’t believe the thought to be completely true?
• Are there any similar previous experiences, which I can learn from?
