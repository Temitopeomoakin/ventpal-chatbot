Tool 7: Containing Worry
Although a certain amount of worrying is normal, sometimes it can feel like our worry is becoming unmanageable. Containing Worry is about allowing yourself to worry as much as you like, but only at a specific time of the day that you will choose yourself.
By following these steps you should notice an improvement in the amount of time you spend worrying and feeling more in control of your worry.
The first thing we need to look at with worry is uncertainty. It is often these types of worries we need to contain. If we find ourselves focusing on worries where the outcome is uncertain, we will soon find ourselves feeling overwhelmed, that things are out of control and this can have an impact on our lives. These worries can usually start with “what if…?”
On the other hand, some of the things we might find ourselves worrying about are the types of things we could deal with in the ‘here and now’. These are the types of things we should try to deal with there and then.
As a result, when looking at worries, we’re looking at either hypothetical worries, which are based on uncertainty, or practical worries which we can deal with in the here and now.
So when you have a worry, write it down and ask yourself the following;
Can I deal with this worry now?
No
Yes Write it down and contain it – Then
Do it! worry about it later!
So, we’ve written the worry down, but what do we do now? Well follow these simple steps to try to contain your worry.
