Tool 6: Facing Your Fears
Graded Exposure
It makes sense for us to avoid the situations we fear as our anxiety quickly reduces. Whilst this may be helpful in the short-term, by avoiding situations that we are anxious about the level of anxiety will remain or increase around that situation. As we continue avoiding these types of situations, it makes it even harder for us to face these situations in the long-term. There are two elements involved in anxiety; we overestimate the threat (for instance going on a rollercoaster, feeling dizzy and you think, ‘I will faint. )’ The other component to anxiety is that we underestimate our ability to cope with the threat (for example, ‘it will be awful and I won’t be able to cope’). Our bodies have over learnt to keep monitoring and scanning for potential treats or triggers. These can be external, for example seeing a spider, and internal, noticing our heart beating faster. Whenever the body recognises a threat the fight or flight response is activated, and our body becomes physically prepared to respond to this threat. As a result, we need to help the body learn that the stimulus is not such a threat, by helping to cancel out when it’s not needed. The CBT technique we use is Graded
Exposure. We will teach our bodies to overcome our fear by becoming habituated to the trigger or threat. For example when we get into a cold swimming pool on a hot day our bodies eventually adjust and it feels warmer even though the water temperature is the same. So we become habituated to the temperature of the pool if we stay in there for long enough. Graded Exposure helps to break this cycle of avoidance in manageable steps.
