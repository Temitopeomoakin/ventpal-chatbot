Steps for Exposure
Step 1: Make a list of the objects or situations which cause you anxiety.
Step 2: Rank this list in order of difficulty from the least anxiety provoking to the most
Step 3: Use this list to create your graded ladder for exposure.
Step 4: Use your exposure diary to record your progress.
Start with the first step, and make sure that it’s not too difficult.
Each time you face a situation you will need to stay in it until your anxiety levels have reduced by at least half of what they were originally.
You will repeat each step at least four or five times in the same week if possible. Once you are able to better cope in each of these situations, or your anxiety before the exercise has reduced, you can move on to the next step on your anxiety ladder.
Remember expose without using distraction, relaxation or breathing exercises so you can feel the anxiety peak and reduce. We call these ‘safety behaviours’.
When completing any exposure tasks, it may be helpful to keep an anxiety diary. This can allow you to rate your levels of anxiety before, during and after your exposure exercise. You can also make notes or write down any of your thoughts at the time.
Please use the blank anxiety diary on the next page.
