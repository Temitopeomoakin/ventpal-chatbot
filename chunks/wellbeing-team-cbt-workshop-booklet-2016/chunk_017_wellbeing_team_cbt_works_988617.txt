A Cognitive Behavioural Therapy
Based Approach
What is CBT?
Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) can help people look at the different situations that they find themselves in, and to understand their thoughts, physical sensations and behaviours. The idea is that our thoughts, physical symptoms and behaviour can all influence one another and therefore contribute in maintaining unhelpful moods such as low mood and anxiety. Take a look at the diagram below.

(Thoughts) (What we do)
CBT emphasises that it is not necessarily the situation that causes the emotional distress that an individual experiences, but rather it is the individual’s interpretation or view of that situation that leads to this. CBT works by learning how to challenge negative thoughts and learning how to change unhelpful behaviours.
When feeling low or anxious, it is common to have Negative Automatic Thoughts
(NATs). These are unhelpful thoughts that pop into our minds without any effort.
With anxiety, NATs are often about overestimating threat and underestimating an individual’s ability to cope, which can maintain anxiety. Sometimes people find coping mechanisms which help them deal with the situation. This may involve avoiding the situation, or doing something differently to help control their anxiety. Although this may lower their anxiety in the short term, it can actually maintain and reinforce it in the long term. Breaking this vicious cycle may cause an increase in anxiety to begin with but ultimately help reduce it.
