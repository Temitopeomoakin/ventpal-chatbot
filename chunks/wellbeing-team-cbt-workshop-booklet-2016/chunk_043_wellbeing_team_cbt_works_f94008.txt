Step 4 – Complete the Activities. Make sure to follow the plan and not the mood! Do the activities you have scheduled even if you don’t feel like doing them.

Ask yourself the following questions:
What impact did increased activity have on your mood?
Were any activities more helpful in making you feel better?
What will you include in next week’s activity schedule? (You may want to add some new more difficult activities, or you may want to increase some of the existing activities)
Final Behavioural Activation Notes
Do not wait until you feel like completing an activity. When we’re feeling low it may take quite some time before we feel encouraged to do an activity, especially one which is quite burdensome. As a result, the behavioural activation technique encourages us to do the activity even if we do not feel like doing it.
It may take some time for the effects of the behavioural activation technique to become apparent. This can be difficult, as the effects of relief received from reduced activity are more immediate. However, bear in mind the increase of unhelpful behaviours can have a secondary impact on our lives which can reduce our mood further.
With continued use of the behavioural activation technique, you should see an improvement in your mood. Make sure to plan, do and review your activities and continue to use the technique for as long as you need.
