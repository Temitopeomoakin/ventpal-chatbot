Repeat this process for any other worries that occur. If you find yourself slipping, make sure to remind yourself you will worry about these later on at the time you’ve designated and get back to focusing on your current activity. Regular practice of worry time really helps you to manage your worries during the day. Step Four: Scheduled appointment – Now Worry! During the appointment you have allotted yourself, you can worry as much as you like about the worries you’ve written down. Choose one you would like to start with and work from there. You may find that these worries are no longer as strong as they initially seemed. The urgency of the worries may have reduced. We often find the worries are not as important or applicable as when they first occurred. You can spend time reflecting on worries that are no longer an issue but this is not compulsory. You may find that you can happily reduce your worry time as you become more practiced at the technique
Make sure you only worry about the worries you have wrote down that day in the worry diary. Any new worries will need to be written down and included in the next day’s worry appointment. At the end of your appointment, you stop your worry. Some people like to throw away their worry list for that day, each day starting with a fresh worry diary. This technique takes practice and repetition. The more we practice this, the more our worries will reduce and this will help us to manage our worry better. Continued practice of this technique may help you to find that you worry less outside of your designated worry appointment and feeling more able to manage your worries. If so, great!
