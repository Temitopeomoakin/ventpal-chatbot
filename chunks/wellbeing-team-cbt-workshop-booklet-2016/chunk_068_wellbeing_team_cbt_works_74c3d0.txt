What is the difference between a thought and an emotion?
Thoughts are usually a sentence or statement, about something or someone. An emotion is one word which describes how we feel.
Examples of thoughts include:
“Nobody likes me” “Everything always goes wrong for me”
“If I am late for work, I will lose my job” “They think I’m stupid”
Examples of emotions include: angry, happy, anxious, depressed, etc.
There are 3 Steps in Cognitive Restructuring:
Step 1: Catching Thoughts
Step 2: Looking for the Evidence
Step 3: Finding an Evidence Based/Alternative Thought
Step One: Catching Thoughts
Start by identifying a situation that has caused you to experience a strong negative emotion.
• First write details about that situation. It might not be the situation that caused the negative thoughts or emotions but by writing down details it will help you remember better what was going on.
• Then write down all the different emotions and thoughts you were experiencing.
For the each emotions rate how strongly you felt it, 0 (barely felt it) to 100% (very strongly experienced it). For each thought rate how much you believe it, 0 (don’t believe it at all) to 100% (very strongly believe it).
• Next try and identify the “hot thought” in the situation. This thought is often rated the highest and most likely to be the cause of the negative emotion. It will have a rating of 60% or higher and match the negative emotion.
Catching negative thoughts can be difficult as it is often something that we are not used to doing. For that reason, you might need to practice this first stage a few times.
