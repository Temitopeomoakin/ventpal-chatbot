Tool 1: Understanding Depression
What is depression or low mood? Depression is a distressing experience. Physical symptoms of low mood can affect the way that we think, what we do and how we feel. This can then spiral into a vicious cycle,
making it harder to cope, to do the things that we used to do, our thinking continues to be negative or unhelpful. This then reinforces how low we feel physically and mentally. Our thoughts can be very negative when we’re depressed. We can be unkind and critical of ourselves. We might overgeneralise or catastrophize, we might jump to conclusions,
we might think that we know what other people are thinking (mind reading). We can find it very difficult to see anything positive in our situation, only the bad. We might even think that our feelings are indeed facts. We can feel quite hopeless about the future. Research has shown that the main causes for low mood can be linked to genetics,
biology, early difficult experiences in life, ongoing stress or life events. Different factors contribute to people’s depression but the symptoms are very common to all. It is thought that a combination of low serotonin (a chemical within the brain), inactivity and unhelpful thoughts all lead to depression. Some say it is the body’s way of saying we need to do something about this. We tend to default to negative thinking when we are depressed. We may think that other people do not like us. We may withdraw from work or social activities. In the short term is easier to cope with not seeing people or going out. On top of that we may have difficulties sleeping, or eating well. We may feel guilty if we are irritable or grumpy towards our friends and family or if we overeat.
