Step One: Make an appointment to contain your worry
Plan a short time for yourself to worry in (i.e. 8pm) and for how long for (i.e. 20 minutes). This time will vary, and perhaps be longer at the beginning, reducing the more you practice the technique. During this time you will not do anything else aside from worrying! Don’t do this just before bed, or in the bedroom. Try and find a place where you can worry and where you will not be disturbed. Try not to be distracted, make sure others are aware not to disturb you. Step Two: Write down your worries
When worrying outside your planned worry appointment, write down your hypothetical worries in a worry diary. If it’s a practical worry, you can deal with it there and then, or plan a suitable time to deal with this
Until you get used to identifying the difference between a hypothetical and a practical worry, use this worry diary to distinguish the two. When a worry occurs write these worries down knowing you can worry about it as much as you want during the scheduled worry appointment. Step Three: Refocusing on the Present
Once you have written down your worry, refocus on the present moment. Focus on what is going on around you and tune your attention onto it. It is harder to worry when you are really focused in the moment. Perhaps consider your five senses and focus on those. It may be focusing on the smell of the cooking, taste of the food you’re eating, the sound of the rain, the touch of a steering wheel and sight of a car in front of you. This is not about distracting ourselves; it’s about bringing us back into the present moment.
