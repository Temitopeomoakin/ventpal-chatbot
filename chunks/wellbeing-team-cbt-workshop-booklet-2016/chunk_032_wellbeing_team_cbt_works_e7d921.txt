Tool 4: Lifestyle Changes
Exercise
Increasing physical activity has a number of health benefits. Not only can it help to lose,
or maintain a healthy weight, but it can also help to reduce the risk of heart disease,
stroke and type-2 diabetes.
Being healthy and increasing our health levels can be achieved by introducing or increasing levels of physical activity and muscle-strengthening activity.
The Department of health recommends 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity activity each week, or alternatively, 75 minutes of vigorously intensity activity.
Examples of Moderate-intensity activities include:
Fast walking Hiking
Cycling Skateboarding
Volleyball Basketball
These types of activities will increase your heart rate, breathing and make you feel hotter. The 150 minutes can be broken up into 30 minutes of activity 5 days a week.
Examples of vigorous-intensity activities include:
Jogging or running Swimming fast
Sports such as football, tennis or rugby Football
Fast cycling (or cycling around hills) Tennis
Aerobics and gymnastics Martial arts
These types of vigorous activity will leave you breathing hard and fast. Your heart rate will have increased and you may find it difficult to say more than a few words without catching your breath.
Examples of muscle-strengthening activities:
Lifting weights Push-ups and sit-ups
Yoga Heavy gardening
Muscle-strengthening activities are in repetitions and sets. One push-up counts as a repetition and 8-12 of these are recommended to complete a set. Try to do 2-3 sets if possible. Muscle-strengthening activities are most beneficial if completed to the point where you struggle to complete another repetition.
