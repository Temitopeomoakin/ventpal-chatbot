• Rate belief in the new revised (balanced) thought
• Re-rate the original emotions in light of revised (balanced) thought
The aim of this technique is to reduce the strength of the negative emotion. The more you practice it the more automatic it becomes and you should be able to use it in the moment.
Summary of the technique
Step One:
Identify a specific situation when you felt a certain negative emotional state (e.g.
anxiety, depression).
Label the emotion (e.g. depressed, anxious, low, sad).
Rate the intensity of the emotion – 0-100%.
Identify the NATs that were running through your mind at the time.
Rate your belief in the thoughts (when you were in the situation) 0-100%.
Identify your ‘hot thought’. The only thought we will challenge - the one which causes the most emotional distress for you, normally with a belief rating of 60% or more.
Step Two:
Identify evidence (facts) for the ‘hot’ thought.
Identify evidence (facts) against the ‘hot’ thought.
Stage Three:
Once the evidence for and against has been collected, reconsider your thought in light of the evidence.
Use the facts gathered in stage 3 and combine them with ‘and’, ‘or’, ‘but’ to come up with a more revised, balanced thought.
Rate belief in the new revised (balanced) thought.
Re-rate the emotion in light of revised (balanced) thought.
