Tool 3: Setting a Goal
In order for any self-help to be effective, it is important to set some SMART goals. They are important as they help us monitor our progress which helps further motivate and energize. They are also a reminder of what you are working towards which means you are more likely to stay on track.

Self-Help is like a Road Map
Imagine you’re planning a journey and you are looking for directions.
Is it possible to get directions to a destination that you do not know yet?
In the same way if you do not have any goals, how do we know what techniques to use to help you reach your goals?
Self-help goals can be either short term, medium term or long term. Long term goals may take years to achieve whereas short term goals may be achievable in a matter of weeks. When thinking of self-help goals, it may be a good idea to start breaking down the steps in order to create some short or medium term goals.
Once you have created your goals, you start your journey towards recovery. It can be useful getting help deciding on the destination and which route you are taking. Once the journey has started, it’s up to you to practice working through the new techniques learnt to reach your destination.
