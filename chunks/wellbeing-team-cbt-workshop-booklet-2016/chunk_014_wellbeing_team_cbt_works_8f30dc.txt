We may also find ourselves engaging in ‘safety seeking behaviours’. These are usually short-term solutions which artificially reduce anxiety and continue to maintain the problem and can lead to continued avoidance.
These behaviours also mean that we do not give ourselves an opportunity to see we would be able to cope without them.
Some safety seeking behaviours include: Carrying a water bottle, a paper bag,
medication, taking someone with you, having headphones on listening to music all the time.
Some people have been told to carry a paper bag or when feeling anxious concentrate on breathing, this is not helpful when learning to overcome panic.
