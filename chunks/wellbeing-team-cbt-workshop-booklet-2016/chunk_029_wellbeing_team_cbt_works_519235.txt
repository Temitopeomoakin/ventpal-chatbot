Include starchy foods
Foods such as potatoes, pasta, bread, rice and cereals should make up around on third of your diet. Try to incorporate this into your main meal if you can. Also try to choose wholegrain options when available, as these contain fibre which can help you to feel full for longer. Reduce fat and sugar intake
Try not to eat foods that are too high in saturated fats. These types of fats can increase the risk of heart disease. Where possible use vegetable oil or reduced-fat spread rather than butter or lard. Also try to have lean cuts of meat, and cut off any visible fat where possible. Where possible, instead of saturated fats, eat food such as oily fish and avocados which contain unsaturated fats. Try to reduce sugar intake. Watch out for drinks which are high in sugar (including alcoholic drinks) as these can often be contributing to weight gain. Whilst there are naturally found sugars in foods such as fruit and milk, it’s helpful to limit foods such as cakes, pastries, fizzy drinks and biscuits which have added sugars. Check packaging to make sure that you limit these types of foods as much as possible. Reduce salt intake
Too much salt can raise blood pressure, so make sure that you don’t add too much salt to your food. Make sure to check food labels, as salt is already in a lot of food we regularly consume. Some foods such as bacon, cheese and salty fish are more obviously high in salt. However many are not as aware that foods such as breakfast cereals, condiments, soup and bread that contain varying levels of salt also. When checking labels if there is more than 1.5g of salt per 100g, this means it is high in salt.
