Thoughts such as ‘what’s the point’
may make it difficult to motivate ourselves to get up and dressed. When experiencing depression we can also have thoughts about harming ourselves or others. We can think that life is not worth living, wishing that we did not wake up or may have fleeting thoughts about harming or killing ourselves. These kinds of thoughts are a quite common symptom of depression and it can be frightening. If these thoughts become unmanageable and you feel suicidal please see your GP urgently, call 111, call the Mental Health helpline on 01438 843322, or attend your nearest A&E. Contacting these services will enable you to receive the more immediate support needed to help you overcome this. Your GP may have prescribed you antidepressants to help you feel better by reducing some of the symptoms of depression. Talk to your GP or PWP if you have any questions about how to manage your medication. By using the CBT techniques within this booklet we hope to help you make those life changes to enable recovery.
