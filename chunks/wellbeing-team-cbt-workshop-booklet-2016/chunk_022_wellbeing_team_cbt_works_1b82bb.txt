Let’s look at some examples of SMART goals:
Whilst I am looking for a job, I would like to call 3 prospective employers each week and ask them about any vacancies.
I would like to be able to do this within the next 3 weeks.
I would like to meet a friend for a drink 2 times a week and spend 30 minutes with them. I would like to achieve this within the next 3 months.
I would like to learn how to better control my worrying so that I do not always jump to negative conclusions. Instead of worrying about things all day, I would like to allocate 20 minutes a day to worry. Throughout the day I will write down all my worries then refocus and worry about them at the allocated time. I would like to achieve this by the end of the month.
Let’s look at some examples of goals which are NOT SMART:
I would like to feel less anxious.
I would like to stop avoiding things.
I would like to do the things I used to do.
