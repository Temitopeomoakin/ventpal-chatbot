Getting a Better Night Sleep
Here are some tips for how you can improve your sleep
•
Don’t go to bed unless you are sleepy. Read a book, listen to soft music or browse through a magazine. Find something relaxing, but not stimulating. •
Watching TV or using electronic devices (tablets, computers or mobile phones) is best avoided at bed time. Not only can the light they emit delay the onset of sleep,
but it can also be too stimulating. •
If you’re not asleep after 15 minutes then get out of bed. Find something else to do which will make you feel more relaxed. Once you feel sleepy again, go back to bed. •
Begin a routine that helps you relax each night before bed. This could be a warm bath, getting into your pyjamas or reading away from your bedroom. •
Go to bed and get up at the same time. This helps the body to recognise a routine for sleep. Do this on weekends and holidays. •
Avoid taking naps. If you must take a nap, try to limit this (less than half an hour). Otherwise this reduces our need for sleep when it comes to our evening routine. •
Keep a regular schedule. Regular times for meals, medications, chores and other activities help to keep the inner body clock running smoothly. •
Only use your bedroom for sleep and sex. Don’t read, write, eat, watch TV, or use any electronic devices in bed. •
Try to limit caffeine as much as possible and at least 4 hours before bedtime (this includes tea, coffee and even chocolate). •
Do not have a cigarette or any other source of nicotine before bed as this is a stimulant. •
Do not use alcohol to help with sleep problems.
