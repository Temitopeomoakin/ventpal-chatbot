• Have a pen and paper or worry diary next to the bed. You can then write down anything making you feel anxious, so it can be dealt with the next day.
• Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, cool and that your mattress is comfy.
•
Avoid having clocks on display
“Get up if you can’t sleep”
•
If you are in bed for 15 minutes and can’t get to sleep, then get up and do something quiet in a different room. Choose an activity that’s not too stimulating and also make sure the lights are low.
•
During this time avoid any activities which might be too stimulating. Try not to use any electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, computers or
TV.
•
Do this until you feel sleepy, then go back to bed.
•
Repeat this cycle until you fall asleep in bed. This helps us to associate our bed with sleep.
