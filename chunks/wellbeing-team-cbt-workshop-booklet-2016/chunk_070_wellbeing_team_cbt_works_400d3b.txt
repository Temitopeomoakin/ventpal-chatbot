Court Case Drama
Imagine you are a judge in a court case. The defendant is on trial for shop lifting. He seems very convincing stating his innocence that “I didn’t do it”. The prosecution has CCTV footage of the defendant stealing an item of clothing from the shop.
What evidence do you think the judge will use to make their decision, and what do you think the outcome will be?
Thought challenging is also like being the judge in your own court case. The defendant is your negative automatic thought, for example “everyone hates me”. When presenting the evidence that supports this, how reliable and robust is it? “Everyone hates me, I just know it” is that good, strong enough evidence?
Consider all the evidence and create your own verdict by using an evidence based alternative thought.
Step Three: Finding an Evidence Based/Alternative Thought
Finally you need to create a new alternative thought, based on the evidence created at Stage 2.
This is not about creating a positive thought, rather it is about creating a more balanced thought which takes into consider both sides of the evidence.
• To create an evidence based thought write a sentence to summarise the “evidence for” and another sentence to summarise the “evidence against” the hot thought.
You can use words such as ‘or’, ‘and’ or ‘but’ to link the evidence together to create the revised (balanced) thought.
i.e. - I failed this one job interview but I have got several jobs in the past
I have gone for.
