Problem Solving in Action
Imran was offered a job interview for next Thursday at 4pm but he was due to pick up his son from nursery at the same time. He started worrying about this and became anxious. He decided to try and use a problem solving approach to help with his situation. 1. Identify the problem – I have to be in two different places at the same time. I need to pick up my son and also attend a job interview. 2. Identify all possible solutions –
•
I could ask my wife to pick up our son
•
I could ask if any of my friends are free
•
I could call the employer and ask if the interview time could be changed
3. Evaluate pros and cons –
• I could ask my wife to pick up our son – My wife might get angry, but she might be free and available. • I could ask if any of my friends are free – More chance of someone being free, but they might feel compelled to say yes. • I could call the employer and ask if the interview time could be changed –
It might be possible to change the interview time but I don’t think it looks good to the prospective employer
4. Select a solution – After thinking about the pros and cons, Imran ranked his solutions in the following order:
•
I could ask my wife to pick up our son
•
I could ask if any of my friends are free
•
I could call the employer and ask if the interview time could be changed
5. Plan – I can ask her when she comes home from work, after she has had something to eat.
