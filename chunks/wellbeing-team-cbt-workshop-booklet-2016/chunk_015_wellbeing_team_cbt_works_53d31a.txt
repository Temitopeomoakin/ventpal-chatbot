Tool 1: Understanding Worry
What is Worry? We all experience worry from time to time. This can sometimes be helpful for us as it can help us to get a job done, for example, worrying about an interview can help us to prepare for the interview (this is referred to as productive worry). However, sometimes our worry can “take over” and stop us from getting things done (this is referred to as unproductive worry). We may also notice that our worries “jump around” and so we worry about lots of things, including minor concerns. This may mean that we rarely solve our worries but keep moving onto our next worry. It is quite exhausting. Worry can be unhelpful for us when we worry about things that are:
•
Uncertain – Nothing in life is certain. So if we search for something that is certain we will have to keep searching or accept that we will not find it. An example of this can be when trying to be certain that we will be healthy. We may continuously worry about our health and check our body to make sure we are ok.
•
Unpredictable – We do not know what will happen in the future. Worrying about this can stop us from enjoying the present. An example of this can be worrying about our family’s safety. •
Uncontrollable – We cannot always control the situation and the people around us. Worrying about this can also stop us from experiencing the present. An example of this can be worrying about how someone will react to you at work/pub/home; this may stop you from doing a particular activity. When our worry jumps around and when we are worrying about something that is uncertain, unpredictable, and/ or uncontrollable we may then notice feelings of anxiety.
