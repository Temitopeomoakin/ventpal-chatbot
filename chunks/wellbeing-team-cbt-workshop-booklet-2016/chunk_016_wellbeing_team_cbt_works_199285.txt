When this happens, it is common that we experience worry about worrying. When we have been worrying for a long time, this may also lead us to feel less confident and may reduce our self-esteem, affect our sleep and have an impact on our jobs,
relationships and health. We also experience: tension headaches, irritability, fatigue, difficulty concentrating,
muscle aches, and sleep problems. We can then start worrying about our health, the health and wellbeing of our friends and family, this is then very tiring, affects our sleep and makes us tearful and sad. This is the vicious cycle of worry. Please continue to work through the workbook as we will build on the knowledge you have learnt. By practicing some of the techniques in your own time as well as in session,
you will overcome the difficulties that you are presently experiencing. CBT Skills Training Book 14 Wellbeing Services
