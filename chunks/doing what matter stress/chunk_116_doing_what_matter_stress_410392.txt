Summary
Tool 5: MAKING ROOM
Trying to push away difficult thoughts and feelings often does not work very well. So instead, MAKE ROOM for them:
1) NOTICE the difficult thought or feeling with curiosity. Focus your attention on it. Imagine the painful feeling as an object, and notice its size, shape, colour and temperature.
2) NAME the difficult thought or feeling. For example:
“Here is a difficult feeling”
“Here is a difficult thought about the past”
“I notice here is sadness”
“I notice here is a thought that I am weak”
3) Allow the painful feeling or thought to come and go like the weather.
As you breathe, imagine your breath flowing into and around your pain to make room for it. Instead of fighting with the thought or feeling, allow it to move through you, just like the weather moves through the sky. If you are not fighting with the weather, then you will have more time and energy to engage with the world around you and do things that are important to you.
