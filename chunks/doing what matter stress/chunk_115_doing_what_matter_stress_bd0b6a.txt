doing what matter stress
Summary
Tool 4: BEING KIND
BE KIND. Notice pain in yourself and others and respond with kindness.
Unhook from unkind thoughts by NOTICING and NAMING them. Then,
try speaking to yourself kindly. If you are kind to yourself you will have more energy to help others and more motivation to be kind to others, so everyone benefits.
You can also take one of your hands and imagine filling it with kindness.
Place this hand gently somewhere on your body where you feel pain.
Feel the warmth flowing from your hand into your body. See if you can be kind to yourself through this hand.
