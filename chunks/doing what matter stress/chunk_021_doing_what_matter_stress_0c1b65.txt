doing what matter stress
Part 1: GROUNDING
When you give your full attention to any activity, we say you are “engaged” with it.
But when hooked by
THOUGHTS
AND thoughts or feelings,
FEELINGS you are “disengaged”
or “distracted”.
When you give your full attention to any activity, we say you are “focused”.
But when hooked by thoughts or feelings, you are unfocused.
And when we do things in an unfocused way, we often do them poorly, or are unable to enjoy the activity and feel dissatisfied.
