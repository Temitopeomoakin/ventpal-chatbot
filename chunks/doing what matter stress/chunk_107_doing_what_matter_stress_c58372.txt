doing what matter stress
Part 5: MAKING ROOM
Notice its shape, size, and temperature …
…and notice with curiosity what happens.
Your pain might get bigger or smaller; it might stay or it might go.
Your aim is simply to make room for it; to allow it to be there;
to stop fighting it and give it space.
THOUGHTS
AND
FEELINGS
And whenever you get HOOKED and pulled out of the exercise …
…and refocus on
Notice breathing and and name…
making room.
