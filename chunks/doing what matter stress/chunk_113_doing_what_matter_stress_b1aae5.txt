doing what matter stress
Summary
Tool 2: UNHOOKING
UNHOOK YOURSELF with these three steps:
1) NOTICE that a difficult thought or feeling has hooked you. Realize that you are distracted by a difficult thought or feeling, and notice it with curiosity.
2) Then silently NAME the difficult thought or feeling; for example:
“Here is a difficult feeling”
“Here is tightness in my chest”
“Here is a feeling of anger”
“Here is a difficult thought about the past”
“I notice here is a difficult thought”
“I notice here are fears about the future”
3) Then, REFOCUS on what you are doing. Pay full attention to whoever is with you and whatever you are doing.
