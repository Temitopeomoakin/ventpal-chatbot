doing what matter stress
Part 1: GROUNDING
I do not understand what you mean by “engage”.
To “engage” in something means to give it your full attention.
When you are drinking something, do you give it your full attention? Do you savour the smell and the taste?
When you listen to music,
do you give it your full attention? Do you listen to it and enjoy it?
