Summary
Tool 3: ACTING ON YOUR VALUES
Choose the values that are most important to you. For example:
• being kind and caring
• being helpful
• being brave
• being hardworking.
You get to decide which values are most important to you!
Then pick one small way that you can act according to these values in the next week. What will you do? What will you say? Even tiny actions matter!
Remember that there are three approaches to any difficult situation:
1. LEAVE
2. CHANGE WHAT CAN BE CHANGED, ACCEPT THE PAIN THAT CANNOT
BE CHANGED, AND LIVE BY YOUR VALUES
3. GIVE UP AND MOVE AWAY FROM YOUR VALUES.
