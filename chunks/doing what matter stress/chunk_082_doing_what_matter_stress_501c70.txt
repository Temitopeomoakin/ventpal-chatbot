Part 3: ACTING ON YOUR VALUES
Remember, even the tiniest actions matter.
A giant tree grows from a tiny seed. And even in the hardest or most stressful of times, you can take small ACTIONS to live by your values.
When you act on your values,
you will begin to create a more satisfying and fulfilling life.
