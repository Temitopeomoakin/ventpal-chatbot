doing what matter stress
Part 2: UNHOOKING
This is like learning a new language.
It takes a lot of practice!
So remind yourself over and over…
You can also be hooked by unhelpful thoughts.
THIS IS ALL SO STUPID!
IT IS NOT IMPORTANT!
IT WILL NOT HELP!
I AM TOO BUSY!
THERE IS NO POINT!
IT IS A WASTE OF TIME!
I CANNOT DO IT!
