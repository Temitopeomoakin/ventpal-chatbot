Reflection questions
• What type of activities will we be running?
• What practical tasks will be involved?
• How much time will be taken up by weekly or monthly planning and organisational tasks?
• How willing and able are peers to share the organisational responsibilities among each other?
• What processes do we have in place to support the safety of peers? Do we need a nominated individual to uphold them?
• How will people taking on organisational roles or responsibilities be supported? For example, will they be supported by each other as a team, through links with other groups or facilitators, or by an umbrella organisation?
• What makes a good facilitator for our peer support?
Activity 8: Good facilitation
This activity is for people who have decided to have specific facilitator roles in their peer support. The aim of this activity is to explore what types of facilitation you need.
1. U sing the diagram on the next page, describe the qualities that your group need,
or would like, from facilitation. These should be placed in the ‘not important’, ‘less important’, and ’important’ circles. You can use this diagram or draw it on a larger piece of paper. You could write the qualities directly onto the diagram or write them on sticky notes then stick them on.
2. Y ou can use this completed diagram to help you with the next activity about types of leadership.
