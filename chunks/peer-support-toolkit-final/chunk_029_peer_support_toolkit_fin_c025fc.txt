Activity 4: My portrait
The aim of this activity is to help groups get to know each other better and explore what group members would like to offer or share.
The best format for this activity will vary between different sets of people. Some may like to discuss it as a group but others may prefer to complete it on their own.
If you choose to complete this activity, discuss whether you want to keep the completed profiles or dispose of them.
1. U se the template on p.29 or your own format, in a group or in pairs, to help people ask others about their strengths, skills and interests.
2. I f people are comfortable doing so, you could share these with one another.
3. A lso talk about gestures that members would appreciate. This could be something someone could do to show that they care, or how members would like to be treated in certain situations.
