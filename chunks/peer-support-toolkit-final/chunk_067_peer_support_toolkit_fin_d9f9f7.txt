Reflection questions
What type of organisational support can our organisation offer?
• What kind of resources (financial, material, human) do we have available to invest into peer support?
• Do we want to develop our own project as part of our service delivery or do we want to support independent peer support initiatives?
• How much input do we want to have in the structure and content of projects we’re supporting? For example, membership criteria, focus of peer support sessions, who fills leadership positions.
• What kind of training and supervision arrangements should we put in place?
• What kind of safety structures should we put in place?
• Who are our allies and partners who can help provide or share some of these organisational resources?
What type of organisational support does our peer support need?
• What benefits might affiliation with a lead organisation bring?
• How might affiliation with a lead organisation limit what we want to do?
• What type of support are we seeking? For example, financial and material resources
(like free use of venues), safety guidelines, provision of training?
• Which type of lead organisation will fit best with our peer support? For example,
a national mental health organisation, a local mental health organisation or a local organisation with a primary focus on other issues such as migration, disability or domestic violence? This will depend on how we define who our peer support is for.
