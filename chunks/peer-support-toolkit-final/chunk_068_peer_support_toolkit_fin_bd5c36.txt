Activity 12: Mapping your partners and resources
Think about the individuals, groups or organisations that have been helpful to your peer support in the past or could be helpful to you in the future. Discuss how each person or organisation could support your group. Use the cards on p.57, sticky notes, or write directly onto the circles on p.58. You might find it helpful to draw the circles on a large piece of paper.
These partners and resources will be different for every group or project. However,
examples could include:
• your best friend
• your local Council for Voluntary Service (CVS)
• your library
• your council
• cafés nearby
• your local Mind or other local mental health organisations
• other peer support projects
• your funder at the local authority
• other local community and voluntary sector groups and organisations
• national organisations and websites that provide information and advice.
Once you have identified these resources and partners, consider:
• Which ones have been the most helpful?
• Which may be missing from the list?
• Which do you want to have a discussion with?
