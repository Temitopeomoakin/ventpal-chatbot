? Reflection questions
• What are the aims of our peer support? For example, reducing social isolation,
increasing peers’ understanding of mental health difficulties, giving peers an opportunity to openly discuss their experiences? • How do we communicate the aims of our peer support to others? • How comfortable do peers feel about openly discussing their mental health with others? What would make people feel more comfortable doing this? • Do peers share any common interests? • Do we have the skills needed for running a particular type of peer support? - C an anyone within our organisational or peer team deliver educational courses,
run particular activities, or facilitate discussions where peers may be discussing distressing experiences? - H ow can we help people share their talents? - D o we have resources to upskill people to be able to do this? • What kind of venues do we have access to? Are these appropriate for the activities we want to do? For example, peer support with a focus on sharing mental health experiences will require a more confidential space than a social group. • What is our budget? Can we link up with other groups to get access to venues,
activities or expertise for free? Activity 10: Common interests
The aim of this activity is to consider new activities for your peer support. You could do this activity individually then feed back together, or you could complete it together as a group. On the next page, write down the things that you do in a week that you enjoy, what you don’t enjoy and what’s missing. ‘What’s missing’ could be something you already do but would like to do more of, or something you don’t currently get to do. Finally as a group, consider whether you might bring the activities that you like or that are missing into your peer support in the future.
