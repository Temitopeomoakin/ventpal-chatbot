• Is it generally okay not to say anything?

• Are there ways to provide feedback either anonymously, or in a way that doesn’t require talking with the whole group? For example, a suggestion box or talking one-to-one with the facilitator.
• Do we need training or discussion to consider our boundaries (what we feel comfortable sharing, and what we don’t, at the present moment in time)?
