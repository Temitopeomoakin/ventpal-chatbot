Activity 9: Leadership
The aim of this activity is to think a little further about the leadership required in your project. It will be easier if you have completed the diagram in activity 8 (pp.40â€“41), as your previous answers will help you with the four following questions. Discuss each question, writing down your thoughts if you wish to.
Types of leadership
1. Designated leader or collective leadership?
Do you feel the qualities you have identified can be found in one person, or would it be more useful to share out the roles needed? Are there roles that you could give to people who wish to develop their confidence and skills?
2. Peer or non-peer leadership?
Is it essential for the person or people in the leadership roles to also have shared experience of mental health difficulties? If so, why?
3. Training or no training?
What training might the people in leadership roles require?
4. Paid or voluntary?
Which roles should be paid and which voluntary? Why?
