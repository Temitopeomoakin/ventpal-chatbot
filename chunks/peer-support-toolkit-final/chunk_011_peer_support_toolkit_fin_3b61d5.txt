Activity 1: Group membership
This is a suggested activity to help you think about who your group is for, and what you would like members to have in common. You can adapt or create your own activity so that it suits your group’s needs best.
1. Print or draw the circles and box on p.17.
2. Think about things you want your group members to have in common. Add these characteristics to the ‘members’ circle.
3. T hink about characteristics that you can’t include in your group. Add these to the
‘not appropriate for’ circle.
4. Discuss other characteristics that aren’t essential to join your group but are important to think about. Put these in the ‘important to consider’ box. Examples include: age, gender, people in crisis, carers, disability, LGBTQ+ and language. You can use this space to explore any barriers that people may have to taking part.
The activity can be printed and written on, or drawn out to a size that works for you.
You could use sticky notes so characteristics can be easily moved as you discuss them.
See p.16 for an example of how this might look for a men’s group.
