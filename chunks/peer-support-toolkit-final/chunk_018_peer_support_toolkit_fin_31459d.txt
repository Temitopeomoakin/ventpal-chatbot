Activity 2: Mapping your venue
The aim of this activity is to help you establish if your venue is practically suitable for your group and to create a detailed map that you can send to new members.
If you don’t wish to draw your venue, you could carry out this exercise by writing a list of relevant features.
Ideally, you will need to be at your venue to complete this exercise.
1. A rrive at your venue and enter as you would if you were visiting for the first time.
As you go around, check the boxes on the next page to see whether the venue has these features. Other aspects of the building that you may like to consider are access to a telephone and whether you need to undertake a risk assessment of the venue. Is the venue staffed by people who could help in an emergency? Are there any other considerations you need to make for your group?
2. D raw a map of the venue, using the template on p.22 or in a way that suits your group (see the example on the next page).
3. Mark the following on your map:
• where in the building the group meets
• spaces in the building that are in use when your group meets – include details of who uses them and what for if possible
• any available quiet spaces
• bathrooms
• facilities such as a kitchen, or tea and coffee making facilities
• fire exits, fire extinguishers and first aid kits.
