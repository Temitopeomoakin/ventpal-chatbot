Reflection questions
Designated leader or collective leadership?
• Does our peer support need designated leadership roles or could leadership responsibilities be taken on collectively by all peers?
• How will the roles and responsibilities be shared out? How will we decide who does what?
• What kind of leadership roles does our peer support need? For example, facilitators,
mentors, befrienders?
Peer or non-peer leadership?
• Are there peers who are willing and able to take on leadership roles?
• Will the peers in our group respond better to a peer or non-peer leader?
Training or no training?
• What kind of skills are required to carry out the leadership roles?
• Do people in leadership positions already have some of those skills?
• Can we train existing leaders and peers aspiring to become leaders, or do we recruit leaders who already have the necessary skills?
• What resources can we put into training? This includes financial resources as well as skills and capacity to deliver training in-house.
• How much time can people in leadership positions commit to training?
• Who might be able to offer us this training or support?
• Do any organisations offer this training for free?
Paid or voluntary?
• What financial resources do we have for staff salaries and volunteer expenses?
• What type of leadership roles do we have in our peer support?
• How much responsibility are we asking people in leadership roles to take on?
• How much time are we expecting people to invest?
• How are the peers in our peer support likely to perceive people in leadership roles who are paid compared to those who volunteer?
• How will people in leadership roles be supported?
