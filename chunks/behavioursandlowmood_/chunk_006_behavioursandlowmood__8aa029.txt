Step 2. Reflecting on my mood and balance
The next step is to look at the week you’ve had and reflect on any connections between activities and mood.
Reflect
Which were your best days? What is different about these days? Is there anything you can already see that you could try to change?
We then start to work towards a balance of activities including the general structure of the day (routine activities), the things we must do (necessary activities) and the things we do for enjoyment (pleasurable activities). Sometimes our diary isn’t balanced, and it can be helpful to see what we could be missing across our day, or week.
Using your completed baseline diary from page 8, fill in the table below writing down what activities you did that were routine, necessary and pleasurable. Once completed, take a moment to think about whether you had a balance in your activities over the past week.
Routine Necessary Pleasurable
