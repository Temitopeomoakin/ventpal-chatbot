Step 5. Review and plan further changes
The final step is to review how you found using the activity diary and add a balance of routine,
necessary and pleasurable activities into your week.
There is as much to learn from the things that went well as there is from the things that didn’t go so well – it is important that you recognise both.
Using what you have learned you can go back to Step 2 on page 9 and consider which activities you could plan into next week’s activity planner, perhaps some of the activities you rated as medium difficulty.
Continuing to do this week by week will help you to build on the positive changes you are making.
