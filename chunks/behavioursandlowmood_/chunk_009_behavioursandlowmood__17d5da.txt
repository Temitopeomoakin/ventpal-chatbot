Step 3. Planning my changes
We can now start to plan the activities we would like to start introducing.
Use the blank activity planner on page 12, adding in the activities you identified in Step 2.
Start by trying to include two to three changes, planning them in your activity planner a week in advance and making sure you’re working towards a balance.
It is important when planning your activity planner to make sure any activities you add are SMART:
• Specific – What, when, where, with who?
• Measurable – How will you know you have completed this activity?
• Achievable – Do you have everything you need to achieve this?
• Realistic – Is it realistic?
• Time-focused – What time, what day, for how long?
Example: “Go for a walk” would become a SMART goal of: “At 2pm go for a 30 minute walk with the dog around the block twice”.
Give yourself a reminder
When we write things down it is much harder to ignore them. Once you’ve finished your activity planner, why not pop it on your fridge.
