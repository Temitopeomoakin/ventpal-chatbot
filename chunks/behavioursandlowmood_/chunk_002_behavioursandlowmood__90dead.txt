Are all behaviours helpful?
Sometimes we can find that we not only stop engaging in behaviours which can be helpful to us, but that we can also start doing things that aren’t helpful for us in the long-term (although these things can sometimes bring us some temporary relief).
Examples
 Withdrawing
 Isolating ourselves from friends or family
 Using alcohol or drugs to cope with how we feel
 Neglecting ourselves (e.g. by not eating or showering as much)
 Harming ourselves as a way to cope with how we feel
 Excessive spending
 Seeking reassurancefrom those around us
 Pushing ourselves towards goals that are unrealistic
 Stopping hobbies and activities that bring us pleasure.
Reflect
Do you recognise any of these behaviours?
Do you think they are helpful in the long-term?
This booklet will focus on introducing behaviours that provide a sense of achievement and pleasure, improving your mood and helping you replace any unhelpful behaviours.
