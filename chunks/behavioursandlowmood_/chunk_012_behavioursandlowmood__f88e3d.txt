What if it isn’t working?
Changing how we feel can be a slow process however you should start to feel that bit better each week by following the Behavioural
Activation steps.
Here are our five top tips to try if you’re finding the steps aren’t working for you.
1. Start with the basics
If you aren’t starting to feel better, it may be that you need to first think about your general wellbeing.
Are your basic needs being met? Are you getting enough sleep? Are you eating enough?
If we aren’t eating well and/or sleeping well we may struggle to see an improvement in our mood when working through activities in our weekly planner. Begin with planning in meal and snack times as well as times to get up in the morning and go to bed at night. If you would like more help around improving sleep, speak to your therapist about our sleep guide.
2. Changing activities
Sometimes we can’t have a balance of activities because our situation has changed in a way that means we can’t do things we used to do. For example, if you move to another area you might find it difficult to find the same clubs you were part of before.
In the same way, if you enjoyed running marathons but your health no longer allows this, it can be difficult to find the same enjoyment in other areas. Some of these barriers can be helped using problem solving. If you would like to try problem solving, speak to your therapist about our problem solving guide.
