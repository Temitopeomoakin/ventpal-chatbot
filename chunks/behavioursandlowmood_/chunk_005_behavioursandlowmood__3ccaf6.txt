Step 1. Recording my current activities and mood
To be able to make changes it’s important to understand what you are currently doing.
The first step is to use the worksheet on page 8 to record what you do over the next seven days and reflect on your mood after each part of the day. This is called a baseline diary. The mood rating is 0-10 where 10 is the best your mood could be and 0 is the worst.
See the example below to get an idea of what a baseline diary might look like:
