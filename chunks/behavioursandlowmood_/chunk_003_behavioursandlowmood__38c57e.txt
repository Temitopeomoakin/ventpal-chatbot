How do I start to make changes?
There are many different techniques we use in
Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) but when we want to make changes to our mood and motivation, the first most effective CBT tool we use is called behavioural activation.
What is behavioural activation?
Behavioural activation is based on the idea that our behaviour can have a big impact on our mood and how we feel. We already know (from the low mood cycle on page 3) that when we are feeling low and experiencing negative thoughts we do less activities, which means we miss out on opportunities to experience enjoyment and a sense of achievement. The aim of behavioural activation is to increase our activity level and give us the opportunity to start enjoying life again.
One thing that is important to recognise is that we often do not naturally feel motivated to do our usual activities when our mood is low. The way we change this is by trying “action before motivation”, the idea that sometimes we are not motivated to do something until we start.
