Step 4. Making the changes
Now that we have an activity plan, we can start to use the idea of ‘action before motivation’ by pushing ourselves even when we aren’t feeling motivated to do the activities.
As you start to work through your activity plan, use the activity diary on page 14 to record (as you did for the baseline diary), what you did and how you felt after completing each of the activities that you planned in.
Use the ‘5 minute rule’
If you’re putting something off or struggling to get started,
whether that be getting up and having a shower, cleaning the kitchen, or going for a walk – say to yourself ‘I’m going to give this a go for 5 minutes’ to help make the task feel more manageable.
The first few minutes are always the hardest but once you get started, you’ll feel much better and find you have more energy to keep going.
