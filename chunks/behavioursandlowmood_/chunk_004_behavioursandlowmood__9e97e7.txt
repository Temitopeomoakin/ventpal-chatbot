How do I start to make changes?
Five steps
Over the next few pages we will go through the five steps of behavioural activation:
• Step 1 – Recording your current activities and mood
• Step 2 – Reflecting on your current mood and balance
• Step 3 – Plan changes
• Step 4 – Make changes
• Step 5 – Review
Reflect
Think back to a time when you had to do something you didn’t want to do but did it anyway. It might have been a chore in the house or meeting a friend for coffee, anything at all.
We tend to find the first steps of getting up and getting started are the hardest but once we’ve got started we find we are able to continue. This is an example of “action before motivation”.
