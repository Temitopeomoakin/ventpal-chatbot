What if it isn’t working? 3. Value based goals
If there are activities you can no longer do (whether that be because of your health or change in circumstances) it may be helpful to reflect on what you valued about that activity and try to recreate that value in your life with an activity that you can do. Let’s use the example of the marathon runner – What was it they enjoyed about marathons? Was it exercise? Was it the challenge? Was it being outdoors? Was it the people they met? Was it the competition? By reflecting on what we value we are more able to find a way to incorporate this into our diary. If it was a feeling of competition for example, are there other ways they could find this such as local darts or chess matches? 4. Rumination
We can sometimes find that our thoughts go over and over things that have happened or things that we have done which can have a really negative impact on our mood. We call this ‘ruminating’. We can often find that rumination can lead us to feel less motivated to do things,
especially as the things we are ruminating about cannot be changed, so thinking about them isn’t helpful. If you notice that you ruminate, it can be helpful to put a star on the activity diary when you notice this happening and plan something in this time to avoid this. 5. Flow tasks
A ‘flow task’ is usually something that we can focus on in a way that means we don’t look at the time and can effortlessly not think about anything outside of that task whilst doing it. Examples could include baking, playing an instrument, painting,
colouring or playing a game. If there are any activities that ‘flow’ for you, consider adding them into your diary and see if this brings any relief to how you feel.
