Unhelpful_Thoughts

TV”, think about what you might do instead. For example, “Take up painting again”. Or, rather than “I will stop putting things off at work”, think about some of the benefits you may have from achieving this goal. For example, “I will strive to get on with more things I am given to do at work, and see how far I get with them before seeking any help if I need it”. 14 15
