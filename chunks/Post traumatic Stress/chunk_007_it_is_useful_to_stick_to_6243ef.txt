It is useful to stick to the same order as you work through the muscle groups:
 Hands – clench fist, then relax.
 Arms – bend your elbows and tense your arms. Feel the tension, especially in your upper arms. Remember, do this for a few seconds and then relax.
 Neck – press your head back and roll it from side to side slowly. Feel how the tension moves. Then bring your head forward into a comfortable position.
 Face – there are several muscles here, but it is enough to think about your forehead and jaw. First lower your eyebrows in a frown. Relax your forehead. You can also raise your eyebrows, and then relax. Now, clench your jaw, notice the difference when you relax.
 Chest – take a deep breath, hold it for a few seconds, notice the tension, then relax. Let your breathing return to normal.
 Stomach – tense your stomach muscles as tightly as you can and relax.
 Buttocks – squeeze your buttocks together, and relax.
 Legs – straighten your legs and bend your feet towards your face. Finish by wiggling your toes.
Don’t try too hard, just let it happen. You may find it helpful at first to get a friend or family member to read the instructions to you.
To make best use of relaxation you need to:
 Practice daily.
 Start to use relaxation in everyday situations.
 Learn to relax without having to tense muscles.
 Use parts of the relaxation to help in difficult situations, e.g.
breathing slowly.
 Develop a more relaxed lifestyle.
