Post traumatic Stress
What can I do to help myself overcome the trauma?
It is important to understand that the reactions you are experiencing are very common following trauma, they are not a sign of ‘weakness’ or ‘cracking up’. The following suggestions may help you begin to cope with the post-traumatic reactions.
Things that we describe which may help you are:
 Making sense of the trauma
 Dealing with flashbacks and nightmares
 Overcoming tension, irritability and anger
 Overcoming avoidance
 Overcoming low mood
Making sense of the trauma
Try and find out as much as you can about what really happened. This will allow you to piece together a picture and understanding of the event more clearly. This can help you in your recovery.
If others were involved, talk to them and ask them their views of events. Other victims, helpers from the rescue service, or passers-by, may all be people who would help you gain a broader view of what happened. The rescue services are usually happy to help you in these circumstances.
It may help you to think it through with other people. You may feel the trauma has altered your whole view of life, it is helpful to try and clarify how you now feel and talking can help you do this.
Some people talk to a friend, family member or partner, others may approach their doctor to seek some counselling or psychological therapy. Other people have found that it helps to write down their experiences.
