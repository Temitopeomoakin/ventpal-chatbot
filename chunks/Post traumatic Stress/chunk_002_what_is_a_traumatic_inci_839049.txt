A traumatic incident can be anything that is out of the ordinary range of daily events and is deeply distressing to someone.
Many things can have this impact. It could be a fire, a serious accident, a robbery or burglary, an attack, being a witness to a traumatic event such as a death. This could happen anywhere:
at home, on holiday, during a war or conflict situation. It can be physical or sexual abuse including childhood or domestic abuse. It could be torture.
