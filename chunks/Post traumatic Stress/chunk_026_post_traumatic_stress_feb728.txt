Post traumatic Stress
What further help is available?
We hope the suggestions made in this booklet are helpful to you. They are based largely on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy,
one of the recommended treatments for PTSD. Distress following trauma usually fades with time. However if you feel that you are making little progress then you should seek further help to aid you in overcoming your problems. This would normally be with your GP in the first instance. Consider this in particular if your work performance or relationships are being badly affected, you feel you are no longer coping, or you have had any thoughts of harming yourself. Your GP may refer you for a talking treatment.
The talking treatments that are recommended by NICE (the
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) are Traumafocused Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT), Eye Movement
Desensitization and Reprocessing for non combat related trauma (EMDR), Cognitive Processing Therapy, Narrative
Exposure Therapy and Prolongued Exposure Therapy.
Therapists delivering these treatments need to have special training and accreditation to practice.
Trauma-focused CBT is a talking treatment which helps clients to make sense of and come to terms with traumatic events. In this therapy you will be asked (when you are ready) to talk about what has happened. The therapy focuses on developing a shared understanding of how thoughts, feelings, behaviour and bodily symptoms interact to keep our problems going.
Talking the trauma through helps people to come to terms with it, the therapy also helps manage their problems by helping them to find more helpful ways to think and behave, as described in this booklet. In Cognitive Processing Therapy,
people are taught to challenge their beliefs and assumptions about why the trauma occurred, as well as the effects on the way they behave and view themselves and the world.
