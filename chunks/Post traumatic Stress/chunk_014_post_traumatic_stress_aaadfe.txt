Post traumatic Stress
An object that engages as many of the five senses as possible is better. Can you think of a grounding object that would work for you?
 Sight – you could focus on things around you, the colors and the textures. Or maybe a photograph of something recent to bring you back into the present moment.
 Sound – focus your attention on loud or soothing music, or birdsong or the voice of someone your trust.
 Touch – you could touch something soft and silky or something smooth and cold and focus on this.
 Smell – sniff a strong smell which can bring you in to the present – perfume or nice smelling oils can be a good choice.
 Taste – try tasting something strong – a strong mint or chilli or lemon can bring you in to the here and now.
Overcoming tension, irritability and anger
Tension, irritability and anger are common aspects of a posttraumatic reaction. There may be physical symptoms too including breathlessness, heart racing, over-breathing,
dizziness and muscle tension. Try the following ways of reducing physical symptoms.
In order to reduce the severity of physical symptoms it is useful to ‘nip them in the bud’, by recognising the early signs of tension.
Once you have noticed early signs of tension you can prevent anxiety becoming too severe by using relaxation techniques.
Some people can relax through exercise, yoga, listening to music, watching TV, or reading a book. Others might find relaxation classes more helpful or listening to a recording of relaxation exercises.
For others it is most helpful to have a set of exercises to follow.
