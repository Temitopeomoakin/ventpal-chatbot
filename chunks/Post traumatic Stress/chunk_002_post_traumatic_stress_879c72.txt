Post traumatic Stress
These are the thoughts and feelings of two people who have experienced traumatic incidents.
“I feel terrible, very restless and irritable. This is not like me at all. The car crash happened six months ago but I still can’t feel safe in a car, I feel so fearful I avoid travel wherever possible.
Pictures of the accident come flashing into my mind, they won’t go away and even at night my dreams are more like nightmares with scenes of the crash happening again and again ... I’m exhausted by it ...”
“My whole view of life has changed, I keep thinking why us? I feel very guilty thinking that I should have done more to save my friend who died. I relive the experience all the time, I keep thinking, "if only I had done this”, “if only I had done that”..., I am very low and depressed some of the time..., I think I could have died ..., I can’t think of the future ..., I feel helpless ...”
If you have suffered from a traumatic experience yourself you may have had similar feelings.
This booklet is written by psychologists and aims to help you understand these and other common reactions to trauma and offers some practical suggestions to help you cope. You may find some of the other booklets in this series helpful such as depression and low mood and sleeping problems.
