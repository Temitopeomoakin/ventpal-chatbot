Post traumatic Stress
The following exercise teaches deep muscle relaxation, and many people find it very helpful in reducing overall levels of tension and anxiety.
Deep muscle relaxation - it is helpful to read the instructions first and eventually to learn them. Start by selecting a quiet,
warm, comfortable place where you won’t be disturbed. Choose a time of day when you feel most relaxed to begin with. Lie down, get comfortable, close your eyes. Concentrate on your breathing for a few minutes, breathing slowly and calmly: in,
two-three and out, two-three. Say the words “calm” or “relax” to yourself as you breathe out. The relaxation exercise takes you through different muscle groups, teaching you firstly to tense,
then relax. You should breathe in when tensing and breathe out when you relax. Starting with your hands, clench one tightly.
Think about the tension this produces in the muscles of your hand and forearm.
Study the tension for a few seconds and then relax your hand.
Notice the difference between the tension and the relaxation.
You might feel a slight tingling, this is the relaxation beginning to develop.
Do the same with the other hand.
Each time you relax a group of muscles think how they feel when they’re relaxed. Don’t try to relax, just let go of the tension. Allow your muscles to relax as much as you can. Think about the difference in the way they feel when they’re relaxed and when they’re tense. Now do the same for the other muscles of your body.
Each time tense them for a few seconds and then relax. Study the way they feel and then let go of the tension in them.
