Post traumatic Stress
“It’s controlling me”
“I can’t cope”
“I should have died”
“Why did it have to happen?”
“I can’t see the point anymore”
“I can’t control the thoughts”
Why do we react so strongly to trauma?
There are many reasons why trauma leaves such a strong impact on us emotionally.
Firstly, it often shatters the basic beliefs we have about life: that life is fairly safe, secure and predictable, that life for us has a particular form, meaning and purpose. It may be that the image that we have of ourselves is shattered, we may have responded differently in the crisis from how we expected or wanted to behave.
Secondly, trauma usually occurs suddenly and without warning.
We have no time to adjust to this new experience. It will usually be outside our normal range of experience and we are faced with not knowing what to do or how to behave. You may have felt you were going to die, people around you may have died,
and you are shocked. In the face of this danger your mind holds on to the memory of the trauma very strongly, probably as a natural form of self protection to ensure you never get into that situation again. The result of this is that you are left with the post-traumatic reactions described above.
For most people the reactions will have reduced or disappeared within a few weeks but for some people they can continue. For others the reaction does not start immediately after the traumatic event but begins after a delay.
