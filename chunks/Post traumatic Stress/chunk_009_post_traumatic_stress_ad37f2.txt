Post traumatic Stress
Try to spend a few minutes thinking of ways that you may be able to make sense of what you have been through. Try and jot down some ideas:
 People to speak to in order to find out more.
 People to talk it over with.
 Things you may do yourself, e.g. write down your experiences.

Flashbacks and nightmares
People may find that they continue to be troubled by intrusive unwanted pictures of the trauma in their mind (flashbacks) and by unpleasant dreams or nightmares related to the trauma.
One of the best approaches which has been found to reduce flashbacks and nightmares is to make time each day for reviewing and going over and facing the unpleasant memories or nightmares. This may feel frightening, but research has shown that this review of memories does reduce the intensity of these experiences.
You could put 20 minutes aside each day to calmly think over,
talk over or jot down notes on the trauma. Unwanted flashbacks and nightmares should gradually become less powerful and less frequent. If you have nightmares, it may help to do this soon before you go to bed. You could do this until the memories or nightmares are less strong.
