Post traumatic Stress
Distraction
Once you have made sense of the trauma it is important not to spend a lot more time thinking about the event. Spending a lot of time thinking “what if” or “why” can trigger flashbacks and other symptoms. You can try and reduce this ‘rumination’ by distracting yourself and focusing your attention where you choose. If you find your mind going over and over the event, try shifting your attention elsewhere. Try to look around you. Chose three objects and slowly and on purpose study each of them for
3 minutes, notice the details, the colour, shape, edges, texture of these objects. Distraction doesn’t usually work instantly, and you may need to work at this for at least three minutes before symptoms will begin to reduce. Distraction is not about trying to push thoughts of the trauma out of your mind, which is unlikely to work, and can in in fact make things worse. Neither is distraction about avoidance, but is a technique that can help us control where we wish to focus our mind. Another technique which may be helpful in managing flashbacks, mindful breathing, is described later in the booklet. Grounding
If you are struggling with flashbacks or feeling detached from the here and now you can use grounding techniques to help you move back into the present moment. Find an object that helps to remind you that you are in the here and now, it should not connected in anyway with the trauma. The object should feel nice to hold, it could be a small seashell, a pebble or an acorn. Spend a few minutes each day looking at the object and feeling its weight, look at is colour and size and connect this with the idea that this object represents the here and now. Practice saying to yourself, that was then, this is now.
