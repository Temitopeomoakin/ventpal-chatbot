4. Progressive muscle relaxation
Step by step continued…
7. Arms and palms of the hands – Turn your palms down and make a tight fist with each hand. Bend your elbow and tense your bicep and forearm. Notice the feeling of tension.
As you breathe out, notice how it feels as your arm relaxes and becomes looser.
8. Neck and shoulders – Drop your chin and draw up your shoulders towards your ears. Hold this tension and then relax as you breathe out.
9. Facial muscles – Clench your teeth together which will prompt the muscle in your jaw to start to tighten. Turn the corners of your mouth into a tight smile and squeeze your eyes shut. Take a deep breath as you hold this tension and then exhale and relax your face on your outward breath.
10. Forehead – Raise your eyebrows up and tense the muscles across the forehead and scalp. Notice the tension build and hold it there. As you exhale let the tension go and notice how your forehead feels.
11. Finishing the relaxation exercise – Take a few moments to tune into your breathing from head to toe and notice how your body feels. When you are ready, count backwards from five to one:
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
• Become aware of your surroundings (pay attention to any noises you can hear or smells you notice).
• Move your feet, legs and hands.
• Move your head in small, slow circles.
• Bring your attention back to the room.
• Open your eyes feeling re-energised, refreshed and relaxed.
To get the best out of this exercise, it’s best to do it daily,
not just when you feel anxious or stressed.
