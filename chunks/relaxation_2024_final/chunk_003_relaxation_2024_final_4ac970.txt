2. Four-minute breathing space
Step by step
Find a comfortable position where you can sit or lie down. Closer your eyes or focus your eyes on a fixed point on the floor. This technique is designed to fit into daily life as it is brief. The technique should take around four minutes and can help provide a moment of calm in a busy day. 1. Take a deep breath in and a deep breath out. Repeat three times. 2. Settle into your breathing, let your breath come and go naturally without trying to change it in anyway. 3. Notice if your attention moves away from your breathing and you become distracted by any sounds in your environment. If this happens, acknowledge the sounds and then bring your attention back to your breathing
4. Notice if you become distracted by any thoughts or emotions. Identify these, it may help to say them in your head, for example ‘I feel sad’ or ‘I’m noticing self-critical thoughts’. Once you have acknowledged them, bring your attention back to your breathing. 5. Focus your attention on your nostrils, notice how they feel as you breathe in and out. They may feel cooler as you breathe in and warmer when you breathe out
6. Bring your attention to your chest. Notice that your chest rises as you breathe in and falls as you breathe out. Notice if your shoulders rise as you breathe in and fall as you breathe out. 7. Focus your attention on the stomach area, notice how it feels, if there is any tension there. As you breathe in and then out pay attention to how your stomach expands as you breathe in and contracts as you breathe out. 8. Move your attention to whichever part of your body feels most natural. Bring your attention to your breath and what you are noticing as you breathe in and out.
