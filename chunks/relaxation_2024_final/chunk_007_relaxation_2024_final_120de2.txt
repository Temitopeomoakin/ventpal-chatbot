4. Progressive muscle relaxation
Step by step
One way of helping to calm your mind and relax your body is by learning to relax your muscles. Progressive muscle relaxation is a technique that helps you to relax both mentally and physically by systematically tensing and then relaxing each muscle group within the body. It can be particularly helpful in relieving muscle tension. With each of the muscle groups below, breathe in and tense the muscle group and hold this tension for 3-5 seconds (depending on what is comfortable for you). Breathe out as you release tension. This exercise is not strenuous but if you are experiencing any pain or recent injuries you may wish to check with your healthcare professional before trying this. 1. Feet – As you breathe in, curl your toes so that your muscles in the soles of your feet become tense. Hold the tension and then release as you breathe out. 2. Lower legs – Curl your toes upwards towards your knees creating tension in your calves as you breathe in and relaxing the calf muscle as you breathe out. 3. Knee and upper thigh muscles – Straighten the knees and gently lift your legs from the chair or bed and tighten your thigh muscles as you breath in. Tensing as you breathe in and then relaxing them as you breathe out. 4. Hips and buttocks – Tense the buttock muscles by squeezing them inwards and upwards. Hold the tension as you breathe in and relax your muscles as you breathe out. 5. Abdomen – Observe your abdomen rising and falling with each breath. As you breath in, tighten your stomach muscles by pulling your belly button towards the spine and hold the tension for a count of 3-5 seconds. Relax your muscles as you breathe out.
