3. Body scan
Step by step
This is particularly useful for having an awareness of the physical symptoms of anxiety and depression and learning how to let tension go. It is similar to the four-minute breathing space but designed to offer a longer relaxation exercise. If you are someone who struggles to be present in the moment, this may be a good one to try. 1. Bring your awareness to your chest and focus on your breathing. Centre your attention to the rise and fall of the chest. 2. Focus on the feet and notice the sensation on the soles, upper part and toes. Imagine that your breath is flowing in and out of the feet and notice any change in sensation or relaxation. 3. Notice the sensation in your ankles and lower calves. Imagine you are breathing from your chest and abdomen all the way through to the feet, in and out, noticing any change. 4. Move up the body, bringing your attention to each group of muscles,
breathing in and out of each limb and body part, letting go of any sensations present. 5. Return to any body parts that you noticed were tense and as you inhale,
visualize your breath reaching the tension and expanding to create an open space. 6. As your attention moves to the top of your head, scan your body again and notice any tension present. Now imagine that you have a breath hole in the top of your head where you will be able to inhale and exhale from, much like a whale or dolphin. Inhale deeply from the top of your head through the breath hole drawing the breath slowly all the way down through the body to the soles of the feet and then returning up along your body. As you breathe out from the breath hole, visualize the breath relieving any tension or discomfort remaining in the body.
