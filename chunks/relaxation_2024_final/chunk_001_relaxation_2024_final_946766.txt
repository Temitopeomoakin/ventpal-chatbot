How can relaxation help?
When you’re feeling stressed, anxious or low,
finding a place of relaxation may seem out of reach, this may be part of the reason you came to NHS Talking Therapies in the first place.
It is common to experience physical tensions alongside emotional stresses too such as:
• Muscle tension
• Headaches
• Back pain
• Tightness in your chest
• A clenched jaw
• Or difficulty breathing
In this workbook we will show you how relaxation techniques that can help you to relax your body and mind.
Putting your body in relaxed state slows your breathing,
lowers blood pressure, and heart rate and can take your mind off distressing thoughts.
Practiced regularly, the calming benefits can be felt throughout the day.
This puts you in a better frame of mind to use the CBT approaches you have already learned in your treatment to improve your mood and feel better overall.
Learning to relax can take time and practice to get better at however and different relaxation techniques work for different people so we will show a few options to try out so you can find out what works for you.
Allocating just 5 minutes a day for relaxation can make a big difference
