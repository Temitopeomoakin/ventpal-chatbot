Step by step continuedâ€¦
6. Take a pause on your walk to admire the scenery. Notice the rolling hills in the distance and neighbouring fields filled with crops. If you look into the distance, you can see a tractor in another field.
7. You start to walk up a slight incline and feel a gentle pull in your calves as they start to stretch. You take a moment to enjoy the gentle breeze against your skin. You take a breath in to fill your lungs with this fresh air. The smell of the meadow fills your nostrils, it smells of freshly cut grass, flowers and lavender.
8. You see a clearing up ahead and walk towards it. There is a bench made of wood and you take a seat. As you sit down you feel yourself relax as you take in the images around you. Lean back in the bench as you relax further and notice the contrast of the warm sun followed by a light breeze on your skin. Take a breath in and out and repeat as you continue to relax. Spend a few moments here relaxing.
9. Once you are ready, open your eyes and reacquaint yourself with the here and now. Take the feelings of peace and relaxation that you felt in the meadow (or wherever your calm place was) with you as you continue your day.
