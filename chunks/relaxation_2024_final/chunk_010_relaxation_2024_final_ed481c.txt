5. Visualisation
Step by step
This exercise is designed to take you away from your mind and racing thoughts by helping you to visualize a relaxed and calm place. For the purpose of this exercise, we have used the image of a meadow, but you can replace with an image you prefer. 1. Start off by taking three deep breaths in and out. Take a moment to tune in and connect with your breath, notice any changes that happen in your body as you breathe. 2. Imagine yourself standing in a meadow, notice the warmth of the sun shining down on you. Visualise a path beneath your feet, look down and notice the path, itâ€™s dry from the sun and bumpy under your foot. 3. Breathe in the fresh air as you start to notice what you can see around you. Imagine that the meadow is filled with wildflowers that are blue, purple and yellow. The flowers are blowing from a gentle breeze in the air. Look up at the dark sky and notice the marshmallow clouds floating up above you. Start to walk through the meadow and as you start to walk,
imagine that your mind and body are relaxing with every step you take. 4. As you are walking, listen to the sounds around you. You can hear the birds singing and tree branches and leaves rustling in the breeze. You come to a stream and hear the gentle trickle of the water babbling. 5. Feel your body relax as you continue to walk. There are trees and bushes either side of the path covered in leaves of autumnal colours. You see that the leaves are green, orange, red and brown. Bring your attention to your breath as you breathe in sync with your footsteps. Feel your muscles relax and lengthen as you are walking along with your arms swinging to the same rhythm as your footsteps.
