Top tips for getting started
1. Decide on a specific time to try out an exercise (the length of time for each exercise can vary).
2. Find a quiet and comfortable location
3. Try to avoid being interrupted – it can be helpful to let the people you live with know what you’re doing
4. Avoid eating a big meal before the exercise
5. Relaxation can be beneficial any time of the day,
however it’s best to choose a time when you’re not too tired (it’s important to stay awake, this can take practice).
6. Check the temperature of the room is right for you
7. It might be useful to record the exercises and play them back to yourself.
