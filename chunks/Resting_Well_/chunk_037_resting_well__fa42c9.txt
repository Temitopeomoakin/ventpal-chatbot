Resting Well: Steps to a Good Night’s Sleep
WELL DONE GETTING THIS FAR!
We hope you’ve started to reap the benefits in the form of a better night’s sleep. Continuing to apply the changes will help you maintain the benefits you’ve seen, although we know that sometimes these changes may start to slide.
In order to keep on top of your sleep it can be helpful to keep an eye out for old, unhelpful habits creeping back in. Take some time to revisit your completed vicious cycle from earlier in the workbook. Fill in the ‘baseline’ column of the My Checking In worksheet below with your old unhelpful sleep habits and the changes you’ve made since using this workbook.
Set yourself a review date (e.g. once a month) to check-in with how your sleep is and to spot any unhelpful sleep habits creeping back in. If any of the changes you’ve made have begun to slip, consider how you can start putting these back into place.
