Resting Well: Steps to a Good Night’s Sleep
STEP 3
STIMULUS CONTROL
How Does Stimulus Control Improve sleep?
Good sleepers fall asleep easily after going to bed and drop off again quickly if they wake during the night. If you ask a good sleeper how they do it, they’ll often look puzzled. Good sleepers don’t try to sleep, they don’t put effort into falling asleep or dropping back off. The reason this happens is that in good sleepers, the brain has a strong learned association between bed and sleep. When in bed, good sleepers recognise the bedroom as a place associated with sleep and rest. This sets off a chain of hormonal and brain responses that set-off and maintain sleep…and they fall asleep.
Poor sleepers however, tend to have a weaker association between bed and sleep and a strong learned association between bed and wakefulness. Bed has become a place connected to being unrested and unrelaxed. As a result, when in bed a chain of hormonal and brain responses results in arousal, a state of heightened tension and wakefulness. For some people, bed can also become a place associated with reading, working, watching
TV or worrying. The bedroom is therefore no longer a place associated with sleep.
The good news
There are lots of things you can do to weaken the association that bed = wakefulness and strengthen the association that bed = sleep.
Stimulus Control is about taking steps to reduce the association between bed and wakefulness and strengthen the association between bed and sleep. Once this happens, getting a good night’s sleep should be possible again.
