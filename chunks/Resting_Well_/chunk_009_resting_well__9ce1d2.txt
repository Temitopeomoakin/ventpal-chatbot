Resting Well: Steps to a Good Night’s Sleep
TIRED OR SLEEPY?
To get a better night’s sleep it can be helpful to recognise differences between experiencing tiredness and being sleepy.
When someone is tired they have a general lack of energy or sense of fatigue and this can affect them anytime during the day. For example, after a hard day’s work, doing the garden or following exercise.
However, people feel sleepy just before they fall asleep and may find themselves struggling to stay awake. When sleepy people commonly report:
n Eyelids becoming heavy and hard to keep open n Difficulty holding their head up n Mind drifting, making it hard to keep our focus
Recognising the difference between tiredness and sleepiness is important moving forward. If you go to bed when you’re tired rather than sleepy, it may take you a long time to get to sleep. This can be something that sets your vicious sleep cycle off.
