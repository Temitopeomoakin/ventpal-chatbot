Resting Well: Steps to a Good Night’s Sleep
STAGE 3 – MAKE FUTHER CHANGES
PLAN YOUR SECOND CHANGE
Once you’ve got into the swing of your first change, use the Stimulus Control Worksheet to schedule a date to make a start on your second change. Make sure to keep the first change going.
Again, ideally keep using the sleep diary to track the effects of your changes, and after a week or so use the Stimulus Control Worksheet to review this new change.
KEEP ADDING YOUR CHANGES
Keep adding further changes as necessary, ensuring you keep the first ones going, until you’ve made all the relevant changes and/or your sleep is back to ‘normal’ for you – whichever comes first! Remember, changing habits is a marathon not a sprint – it’s better to build these changes in slowly and steadily to ensure you are able to maintain them. It’s not unusual for it to take a good few weeks before you start seeing change to your sleep. But keep persevering!
