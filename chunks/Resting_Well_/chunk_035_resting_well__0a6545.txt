Resting Well: Steps to a Good Night’s Sleep
STAGE 6
USE YOUR SLEEP EFFICIENCY TO CREATE A NEW
TIME IN BED PRESCRIPTION
Use your Sleep Efficiency to create a new Time in Bed Prescription (and therefore bed and wake times) for the next week or two. If your sleep efficiency is:
n Below 85%: Reduce the initial Time in Bed Prescription by 15 minutes.
n Between 85% and 89%: Keep the initial Time in Bed Prescription the same.
n 90% or over: Add 15 minutes on to the Time in Bed Prescription.
CREATING A NEW TIME IN BED PRESCRIPTION FOR YUSUF n Yusuf’s Sleep Efficiency over the last week was 81%. He was therefore asleep 81% of the time he was in bed.
n As Sleep Efficiency is less than 85%, Yusuf’s Time in Bed Prescription is reduced by 15 minutes to 351 minutes (5 hours 51 minutes).
n New bed and wake times were set for each day and recorded on a new
Sleep Restriction Worksheet.
STAGE 7 – APPLY NEW TIME IN BED PRESCRIPTION
AND CONTINUE WITH SLEEP DIARY
Put your new Time in Bed Prescription into action and start a new Sleep Diary to recognise any progress and keep track of your nightly and average sleep times.
STAGE 8 – REFLECT AND REPEAT
What do you notice after looking at your new Sleep Diary? If your sleep has improved, great
- keep it up! If you’re not quite there yet, keep going with the sleep restriction making sure to calculate your Sleep Efficiency and adjust your Time in Bed Prescription every week or two.
