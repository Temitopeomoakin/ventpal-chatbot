Resting Well: Steps to a Good Night’s Sleep
HOW DO I GO ABOUT USING STIMULUS CONTROL?
STIMULUS CONTROL IS BASED ON THREE STAGES n Identify Changes to Make.
n Schedule and Begin Your First Change.
n Make Further Changes.
STAGE 1
IDENTIFY CHANGES TO MAKE
After having a look at the Sleep Hygiene Advice and completing your own Sleep Diary, you may have a better understanding of things that could be getting in the way of having a good night’s sleep. If so, that’s great, but it can also be helpful to understand a few helpful changes you can make to improve your sleep.
n Work your way through the Behavioural Changes to Make Worksheet.
n Tick Need for Change where the behaviour listed is one you need to change.
Remember...
If you find yourself struggling with this, raise it with any person that may be supporting you. Or if you’re using the workbook on your own, asking for help from someone you trust, like a family member or friend can help.
