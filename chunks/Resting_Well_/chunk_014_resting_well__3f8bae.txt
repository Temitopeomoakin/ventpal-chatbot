Resting Well: Steps to a Good Night’s Sleep
YUSUF’S STORY
I’d been having sleep difficulties for a long time
I was waking up many times throughout the night and ended up staying in bed late to try and catch up on sleep. In the end I decided I needed to seek help and got an appointment with a Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner called Antonia. After our assessment, Antonia explained we could work on an intervention together to help with my sleep.
I told Antonia I’d read about something called sleep restriction which is meant to be very helpful for people with insomnia.
After trying a few other approaches to help with my sleep but still struggling, we discussed options moving forward.
We agreed that as I had a strong preference for sleep restriction, we could work on this. The first thing I did was to complete a sleep diary.
As you progress through the workbook, you’ll be able to see examples of completed worksheets.
This can help if you get stuck between support sessions or if you’re using it on your own.
