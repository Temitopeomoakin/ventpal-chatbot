Resting Well: Steps to a Good Night’s Sleep
STAGE 3:
CALCULATE YOUR TIME IN BED PRESCRIPTION
Your Time in Bed Prescription is the amount of time you should be spending in bed each night between now and your next check-in. You calculate your Time in Bed Prescription by adding 30 minutes to your Average Sleep Time. Once you’ve done this write it on the
Sleep Restriction Worksheet. It’s helpful to have this recorded in minutes and hours. Use your Time in Bed Prescription to decide on a fixed bed time and wake time, making a note of these on the worksheet. When deciding your bed and wake times think about how you can make these fit in with your lifestyle. CAUTION! Your calculated time in bed should never be less than 5 hours (300 minutes). YUSUF’S EXAMPLE
Yusuf’s average Total Sleep Time was
334 minutes (5 hours 34 minutes). To get his Time in Bed Prescription 30 minutes was added. So Yusuf’s Time in Bed Prescription is 364 minutes (6 hours and 4 minutes). You may be thinking that this doesn’t seem like very much time to spend in bed each night, especially if you spend a lot of time in bed at the moment. But, your Time in Bed
Prescription allows you to spend more time in bed each night than the amount of sleep you’r currently getting on average. STAGE 4:
PUT YOUR TIME IN BED PRESCRIPTION INTO ACTION
Now implement your Time in Bed Prescription by putting your fixed bed and wake times into place. This can feel difficult as you may find yourself facing some barriers that may get in the way of you sticking to it. Consider these barriers and how you might overcome them on the Sleep Restriction Worksheet. You may want to discuss these with anyone supporting you, a friend or family member.
