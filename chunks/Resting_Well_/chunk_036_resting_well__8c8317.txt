Resting Well: Steps to a Good Night’s Sleep
TIPS TO HELP YOU STICK TO YOUR TIME IN BED
PRESCRIPTION n Remind yourself how sleep restriction works.
n Remember that even though this method might feel uncomfortable in the short term,
it can be very effective and help you sleep better in the long run.
n Make sure you speak to anyone you share a bed with about your new bed and wake times as it may affect them. Explaining the rationale and reassuring them that the changes aren’t permanent might help.
n If your set bedtime means staying up later than normal, have a think about what you can do during that time to stop you nodding off on the sofa.
n Think about something to help you get up in the morning if your wake time is earlier than usual. For example planning a nice breakfast or getting out for an early walk.
n Remember that keeping going is key. You need to stick to the agreed bed and wake times every night in order for Sleep Restriction to be as effective as possible.
