Resting Well: Steps to a Good Night’s Sleep
STAGE 2
SCHEDULE AND BEGIN YOUR FIRST CHANGE
Now it’s time to schedule and begin your change. You’ll need to stick with them, even if this temporarily reduces the quality or quantity of your sleep.
Identify a change to make and schedule it as Change 1 in the Stimulus Control Worksheet. Think about ways you could bring about the change for at least a week. Be as specific as you can and write it down under How I can apply this:
n Consider barriers that could get in the way and how you can overcome these. Write these on the worksheet too.
n If you feel more tired to start with, don’t be tempted to resort to unhelpful coping strategies such as drinking more caffeine or napping which will set off the Unhelpful Sleep Cycle. Instead try to relax,
shift your attention onto something else and ride it out, it should soon settle.
n After a week or so use the How Did It Go box on the Stimulus
Control Worksheet to review the changes and its effects.
n Continue to keep a sleep diary, so you can track the effects of your changes.
n If you feel especially tired, avoid driving or any other activities that require a lot of focus.
