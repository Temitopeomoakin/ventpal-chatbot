Resting Well: Steps to a Good Night’s Sleep
STEP 2
COMPLETE A SLEEP DIARY
Hopefully, understanding your own Sleep Hygiene has been helpful and if you’ve identified any areas for improvement, you’ve started to put them into action. For some people just doing this will be enough to help them get a better night’s sleep.
If thinking about your Sleep Hygiene has been helpful, case consider if you want to move on to making your own Sleep Diary. If you wish to continue, completing it will give you a better idea as to how you’re sleeping and maybe help you identify some of the reasons behind your own sleep difficulties.
n Over the next week have a go at filling out your own sleep diary.
n Try and fill this out every day.
n Convert hours you’ve slept into minutes which will be helpful if you continue with the later steps.
n Once you’ve completed a sleep diary, review it. Look back over the sleep hygiene worksheet. Has the diary highlighted any further changes it might be worth making? Or do you notice any other patterns or problems that may be affecting your sleep?
As covered in Sleep Hygiene Advice, watching the clock during the night is unhelpful so we recommended that you just estimate the timings in the diary.
