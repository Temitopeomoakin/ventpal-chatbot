Resting Well: Steps to a Good Night’s Sleep
WHAT ARE SLEEP DIFFICULTIES?
Sleep difficulties refer to persistent problems with sleep that make it difficult for us to do the things we need or want to do. When they’re not addressed they can lower our mood and leave us unhappy, tired or frustrated.
They can occur before or after mental health difficulties and be experienced alongside medical conditions. If this is the case then they can make these other conditions worse. Improving our sleep may therefore also help us manage other problems we may be having. Whether you are seeking help specifically for sleep difficulties or experience these difficulties alongside other things that may be going on in your life, this workbook may help you get your sleep back on track.
