Resting Well: Steps to a Good Night’s Sleep
WELCOME!
Well done for taking the first step to improve your sleep. Seeking help can be one of the most difficult steps to make!
This Steps to a Good Night’s Sleep workbook is based on an evidence based psychological approach known as Cognitive
Behavioural Therapy (CBT). It will help you understand what makes a good night’s sleep and recognise potential difficulties you’re facing, directing you to specific helpful techniques. This approach has been shown to be effective for many people who experience sleep difficulties that have a big impact on their lives.
This workbook is designed to be supported by a mental health professional trained to help people get the most out of it. Within
England, this may be a Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner (often known as a PWP), working within the Improving Access to
Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme. However, if you don’t have support but think the workbook may be helpful then using it on your own is no problem.
If you choose to use this workbook, you’re in control of how quickly you choose to work your way through it. However,
evidence suggests that the approach is more likely to be effective when people fully engage with the techniques included and try to do a little each day.
