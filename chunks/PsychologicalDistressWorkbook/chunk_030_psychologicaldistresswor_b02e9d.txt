Radical acceptance can be another way of tolerating distress. Radical acceptance does not mean:
Judging that a situation is good

Giving permission for the situation to go on forever

Giving up hope and giving up your options

Instead, radical acceptance involves turning the mind again and again,
to experience a situation exactly as it is, with all of its intricacies. It is accepting exactly how things are, not as we think they should be. You may have to turn your mind again and again in a short period of time and this is normal, as your mind is busy and will want to always come up with other ideas and interpretations. It is trying to come back to the situation exactly as it is, not judging it as good or bad, and just allowing yourself to be in this moment exactly as it is.
