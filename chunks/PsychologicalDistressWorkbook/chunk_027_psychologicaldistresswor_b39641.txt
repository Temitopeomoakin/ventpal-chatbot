Sometimes as many skills as we are able to use to change a situation or how we feel, it is hard or not possible to change it. Distress tolerance skills can be used in these times of crisis when the pain is very intense and difficult or impossible to change. Some acronyms that are used to remember distress tolerance skills in DBT are IMPROVE the moment and wise mind ACCEPTS. Write your own ideas of things you have tried for each example below.
IMPROVE the moment
I imagery for example safe place visualisation
