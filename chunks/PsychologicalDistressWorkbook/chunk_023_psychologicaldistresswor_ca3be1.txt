Managing emotions willâ€¦
1. Help us to be more aware of our emotions
2. Help us to tolerate destructive urges
3. Lower the intensity of the emotion
4. Help give a sense of calmness
5. Help us to label our emotions and understand them
6. Help us to let go of distressing or painful emotions
7. Support us to increase our level of positive thinking
8. Help us to be kinder to ourselves
Another way of managing emotions is by using the opposite action skill. This is by understanding that emotions have urges attached to them and by acting in the opposite way, the emotion can be managed.
