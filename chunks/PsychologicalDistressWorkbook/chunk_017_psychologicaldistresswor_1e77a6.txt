10 minute sitting relaxation mediation
7. Sooner or later, your mind will wander away from the focus of your breath going in and out of your tummy to perhaps thinking about other things,
replaying images and conversations, remembering things from the past or perhaps thinking of things that may happen in the future. This is perfectly okay
— as this is what minds do. When you notice that your attention is no longer on the breath, gently congratulate yourself — as you have noticed that you are no longer in the present moment and that your mind has wandered away. You may want to take note briefly of where your mind has been, and think ah that’s what my mind keeps thinking about. Then gently return your attention back to focusing on your breath and on the changing physical sensations in your tummy. Starting afresh a new intention to keep your attention for as long as you can on the your tummy as and how it changes as you breathe in and as you breathe out. 8. No matter how often you notice that your mind has wandered, as best you can,
congratulate yourself each time on noticing that it has wandered and then gently bring your attention back to the breath and again focus your attention on the changing physical sensations that come with each in breath and outbreath. 9. As best you can, bring a quality of kindliness to yourself, perhaps seeing the repeated wanderings of the mind as opportunities to be able to see your thoughts more clearly and understand what travels through your mind a bit better. And also practise being patient with yourself, as your mind will repeatedly wander and by trying to patiently sit, as best you can, and keep trying to bring your attention back to your body you are training yourself in the skill of mindfulness and being in the moment.
