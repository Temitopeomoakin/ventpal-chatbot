It is important to understand when looking at emotions that there are no emotions that are good or bad. You might feel lots of emotions at once, or you might feel very little. They might change quickly or slowly.
The trick here is to observe them and allow them to be as they are.
What do you notice about your emotions? Are there any that you experience regularly?
Let’s try a Managing Emotion Exercise
1. First think of a situation that makes you feel an emotion you find difficult to tolerate
2. Now, observe the emotion. Acknowledge that it exists, stand back from it and let yourself become unstuck from it.
3. Sometimes imagining that your thoughts/emotions are carriages on a train that is going by can help, or you can use another image like leaves floating on a stream.
4. Now recognise that you are not the emotion, that it is only a part of you, and not all of you.
5. Sit with the emotion—don’t act on it
6. Try and accept the emotion and allow it to exist.
7. Congratulate yourself for any time you have managed to sit with the emotion. This is like training a muscle and gets better with practice.
