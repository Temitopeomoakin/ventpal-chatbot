When we are faced with extreme distress, it can be natural to want to get rid of it as quickly as possible. So sometimes what we can end up doing is using a strategy that is really quick and effective, but that might not help us in the long run. Have a look at the table below at some examples of different strategies.

They are called maladaptive not because you are bad for using them, but because generally they cause you more harm in the long run than they cause benefit in the short term. For example if you are very distressed and drink to cope with that, you will end up with a hangover the next morning, maybe with feelings of shame, maybe you will have acted in uninhibited or aggressive ways, depending on your reaction to alcohol and you will have harmed your body in the process. It is completely understandable however that you would want to use that strategy, considering the level of distress you would have been facing. We are here to learn strategies that can replace those and help you to cope with considerable distress in a healthier way.
Can you add any of your own coping techniques to the table above?
