Ways you can see your thoughts differently
‘It is enormously liberating to realise that thoughts are just thoughts that come and go and not facts, even the ones that say
2,24 they are because they come with strong feelings ! ’
“ W hat I think is true, I am a bad, “ A t the moment I have an angry or angry, or anxious person, it doesn’t anxious mind, so I need to do matter what you say or what I do I will something to calm myself, things will always be like this” look different tomorrow.”
Stop and take a breathing space when you notice your thoughts keep repeating themselves, keep going round and round in your mind, are constantly negative,
difficult, or upsetting then try looking at your thoughts in the following ways:
1. Thoughts are not facts - they may feel like the ‘truth’ because they feel so powerful and overwhelming at times and are accompanied by strong feelings but they are a representation of your way of looking at things at any one moment of time. 2. Watch the thought, without feeling you have to follow it, avoid it, suppress it, get involved in it, react to it you may find that they move on eventually in their own time. 3. Write it down or do some drawings that reflect how you feel
4. Label the thoughts, e.g. this is the voice of grief talking, or the voice of depression, stress, anger, anxiety, and distress. 5. Ask yourself with a non judgmental mind :
 Is this a natural reaction to a challenging situation or event?  Is this confusing thoughts with fact ? Or jumping to conclusions?  Is this getting caught up in harsh judgment or myself or others?  Is this expecting things to be other than they are?
