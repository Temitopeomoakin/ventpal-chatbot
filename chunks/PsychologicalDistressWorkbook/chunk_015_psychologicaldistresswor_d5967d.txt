10 minute sitting relaxation mediation
Try this meditation regularly and often for at least 2 weeks to reduce mind and body states of stress and anxiety
1. Settle into a comfortable sitting position, sit with your back as straight as possible in a dignified and comfortable posture, with an intention to be present and awake. If on a chair, place your feet flat on the floor, with your legs uncrossed and gently close your eyes. 2. Bring your awareness to any physical sensations you may be having right now in your body, this might be focussing your attention on the sensations of touch and pressure in your body where it is making contact with the floor, seat or cushion. Spend a minute noticing what you feel in this part of your body. 3. Now bring your awareness to the changing physical sensations in your lower tummy as the breath moves in and out of your body. 4. Focus your awareness on the sensations of the slight stretching as your tummy wall rises with each in breath and of the gentle release as your tummy wall falls with each outbreath. As best you can, keep your attention on the changing sensations in your tummy all the way through as the breath enters your body on the in breath and all the way through as the breath leaves your body with the outbreath. Perhaps try imagining that your tummy is a balloon that keeps getting blown up with each breath you take and then goes down with time you breathe out. 5. There is no need to try to control your breathing in any wayâ€”simply let the breath breathe itself naturally as your body knows how to do this on its own as it has been breathing all by itself for every day of your life without you ever having to think about it.
