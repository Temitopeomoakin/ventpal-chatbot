Assistant Psychologist posts can also be developed with the aim of recruiting staff from particular ethnic or linguistic groups. There is an excellent resource available online which provides full guidance for services about the use of interpreters in mental health settings (Tribe and Thompson 2008). This guidance has also been used as the basis for guidance specific to CBT (Beck 2016, Chapter 7). A recent paper by Tutani et al. (2018) looks at the advantages and challenges of work with interpreters in IAPT services and provides a thoughtful summary of these issues. Working with BAME service users from faith backgrounds
The degree to which religion, faith and spiritual beliefs shape someone’s world varies as much within BAME communities as it does between them. Therapists can use the same principles of respectful enquiry that they use to ask about ethnic background in order to understand the importance of faith and spirituality in someone’s life and to determine the degree to which these beliefs can be a resource to support recovery. There is recent evidence from IAPT services that Muslim service users have markedly worse outcomes than white English and BAME service users from other religious backgrounds (Baker
2018). This may, in part, be explained by the fact that many Muslim communities are amongst the most economically disadvantaged in England (Citizens UK 2017), with poverty and economic marginalization in turn having a negative impact on recovery rates in IAPT. 20
