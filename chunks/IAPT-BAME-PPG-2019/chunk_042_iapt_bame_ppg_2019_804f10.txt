SECTION 3: ENGAGEMENT WITH SERVICE USERS AND
COMMUNITIES
‘You will not get to know us if we do not get to know you.’ – IAPT service user
Understanding local communities
Effective work with BAME populations must start with commissioners and IAPT providers understanding the communities they serve. Right Care packs are useful resources for this; there are local packs relating both to equalities and health inequalities, and to mental health. Joint
Strategic Needs analysis and census data can be a good starting point; however, commissioners and providers should also use the expertise of local public health departments or the local authority in order to develop an accurate picture of the ethnic composition of the area they serve. Summary: Engaging communities
This is particularly important where particular communities are not accessing IAPT services
Staff from those communities and third-sector colleagues may have ideas about how to start this work
It may take time to build good alliances and trust
Religious organizations can be important links. Secular organizations are also important as not all members of communities are religiously affiliated
It is important to hear from a variety of voices within communities in terms of age, gender,
sexuality and religious affiliation
Steering groups should also include white members of staff
Outreach work can use a variety of community organizations, media and formats
The steering group needs to include some senior members of staff
Service steering groups can be community-specific or represent all communities
Different areas may need to use different criteria for describing the ethnicity of the communities they serve. For example, in an area with a large South Asian community, it might be helpful to distinguish between people who identify as being from different regions in order to meaningfully understand patterns of service use (for example, distinguishing between those who identify as
Pakistani and those who identify as Kashmiri).
