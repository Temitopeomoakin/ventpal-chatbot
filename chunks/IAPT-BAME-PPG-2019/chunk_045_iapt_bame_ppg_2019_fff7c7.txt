IAPT-BAME-PPG-2019
They were successful in recruiting a diverse team of clinicians and, as they have grown, have retained a team that is 50% BAME. Touchstone developed an actively managed direct referral line, which works alongside the main referral route to Leeds IAPT. Whilst this referral route is not solely for BAME referrals,
the majority of referrals to Touchstone IAPT each year have been from BAME communities. Currently 20% of all referrals to Leeds IAPT are from BAME communities, and this is largely due to the success of Touchstone. Clinics are held in areas with large BAME populations,
with virtually all the clinics placed in community venues. The direct referral pathway has also increased the level of engagement among specific disadvantaged groups, such as asylum seekers (20% of all direct referrals in 2018) and people who do not speak English (25% in 2018). Touchstone have also had co-located clinics alongside the direct referral route, such as such as their Step 2 and 3 clinics at the
Leeds Jewish Welfare Board. The team has regularly offered a range of whole-team and individual training to support work with BAME communities over the years, with protected monthly peer CPD time to allow training to be cascaded. Specific projects have evolved out of some of this training, related to providing quality care to clients from BAME Communities, such as depression recovery groups delivered in the Leeds Grand Mosque and a stabilization pilot for asylum seekers with complex PTSD. 28
