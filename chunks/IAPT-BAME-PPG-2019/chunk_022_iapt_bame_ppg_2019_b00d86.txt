conceptualized the role of assessment and interpreting within the therapy process. At the end of the six-month pilot, the project was evaluated, showing that there had been a clear increase in the numbers of referrals and self-referrals from refugees, asylum seekers and refugee staff to the IAPT team
Staff working with refugees and/or asylum seekers should receive additional training in, for example, understanding likely ways that distress is manifested following trauma and the role of dissociation in trauma. Service users may well disclose experiences of torture or being trafficked, economically exploited,
or subject to or at risk of female genital mutilation. This may be the first time that they have disclosed such information. When this occurs, therapists should consider obtaining the consent of the service user where appropriate to:
• ensure the full range of physical health needs are met
• work with the police to ensure patient safety, including liaising with adult safeguarding
• contact legal teams to ensure that they are fully aware of any additional information
• refer to specialist NHS or other services. Where consent to break confidentiality has not been agreed, staff should use supervision and consult with safeguarding teams to establish whether the level of risk warrants breaking confidentiality against the wishes of the service user. Transparency about this process will help maintain the therapeutic relationship. The psychological and social needs of this service user group are more likely to be complex than in those of the general population using IAPT services. It may be necessary to start engagement with stabilization work and provide support around meeting practical needs. This may require therapists to make links with and refer to organisations offering activity groups, faith based support,
food banks, housing specialists and legal advocates. Risk assessments for this group should include consideration of the risk of economic or sexual exploitation, as well as the impact of poverty and the lack of access to safe and stable housing.
