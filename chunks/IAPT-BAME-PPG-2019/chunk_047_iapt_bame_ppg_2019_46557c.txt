The resulting Diversity and Inclusion
Working Group led by Touchstone IAPT has agreed some relatively minor changes to recruitment practices, which have already borne fruit in terms of both an increase in job applications from BAME communities and the proportion of BAME staff shortlisted and appointed. More applications from staff from BAME communities has been encouraged by providing training on identifying unconscious biases on the part of recruiters and running mentoring sessions to prospective trainee PWP and CBT candidates at the application stage to improve interview skills. Who should IAPT services engage with? Direct work with patients, public and service user groups will improve relationships and outcomes,
and NHS commissioners and providers have statutory responsibilities to ensure that engagement takes place (Health and Social Care Act 2012; NHS England 2017). Commissioners should note that their statutory responsibilities to involve patients and public cannot be delegated, and that they retain a responsibility to ensure engagement takes place where services are commissioned
(NHS England 2017 â€“ Statutory Guidance). NHS England has a range of statutory and nonstatutory guidance and resources available on their online Involvement Hub, including specific resources for working with BAME communities. 29
