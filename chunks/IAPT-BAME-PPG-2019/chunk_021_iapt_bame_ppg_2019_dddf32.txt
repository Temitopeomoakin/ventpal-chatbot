Service users should also be told that asking about their background enables their therapist to develop a better understanding of their beliefs and values in order to help them make the changes they have identified as being important to them. Using genograms in assessment and engagement
One useful way to begin to ask about the ethnic, migration and faith backgrounds of service users is to draw a genogram, also known as a family tree, as part of the assessment. The therapist can begin by saying: ‘Would it be okay if we drew out who is at home? It would really help me get to know you better and understand your situation.’
This initial diagram can then be expanded to include other significant people in the family of the service user. This can become the basis for more in-depth questions about where family members were born, migration histories, languages spoken at home, and degrees of acculturation and religious observance. Care should be taken to ensure that the service user is comfortable with that detail of questioning and that the therapist only asks for as much information as is helpful in progressing engagement, formulation and therapeutic change. 14
