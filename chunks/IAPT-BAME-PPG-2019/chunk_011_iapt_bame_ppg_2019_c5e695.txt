IAPT-BAME-PPG-2019
BAME service users have asked for clearer information about waiting times and regular updates from IAPT services in terms of how long their wait is likely to be. These updates and contacts can be used to check for deterioration in mental health, which will increase a sense of engagement with the service and clearly communicate that services are concerned about the well-being of the person being contacted. The Improving Access to Psychological Therapies Manual (2018) – hereafter referred to as the
IAPT Manual – includes useful information about waiting list management, and these principles will be helpful for BAME communities accessing IAPT services. Services should develop a network of BAME community projects they can work with, or connect with existing networks, so they can support social prescribing while people are on waiting lists or as part of therapy. It is important to ensure that these projects are a good fit for the goals, values and preferences of BAME service users. IAPT services may wish to consider funding specific social prescribing projects that are a good fit for the cultural background of service users where an unmet need is identified. Managing DNAs
Many services operate a policy of allowing one or two DNAs before someone is discharged back to the referrer. As some BAME service users may be less likely to attend a first appointment (Beck
2005), this policy could be seen as indirect discrimination. 9
