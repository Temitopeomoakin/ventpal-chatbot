Asylum seekers are usually unable to undertake paid employment whilst waiting for a decision regarding their refugee status. Asylum seekers often have a wealth of experience and skills that are underutilized. In our focus groups, several people said that they would value the opportunity to volunteer in IAPT services, in order to gain skills that would improve their employability once they have obtained refugee status, and to help others experiencing mental health problems. With the right support, volunteers could make helpful contributions to IAPT teams and, over time, join the mental health workforce, bringing valuable perspectives and skills with them. ‘Nothing works better for my mental health than to help others in the same situation.
