SECTION 1: SERVICE-LEVEL CHANGES TO IMPROVE ACCESS
Reducing barriers to accessing services
People from all social backgrounds and communities face barriers to accessing the right sort of mental health support at the right time. There is well-established research literature, including data from IAPT services, that shows people from BAME communities are less likely than those from the white majority population to access the mental health support they need. Summary: Changes that can increase BAME access to IAPT
Work with referrers to increase use of services
Continue to offer self-referral
Make sure there are other routes into services besides self-referral
Consider the literacy and language proficiency of service users
Make leaflets about how the service works available in community languages
Use the Internet, social media and community media to make people aware of the help available and how to access it
Be flexible around appointments and DNAs
Use initial telephone contact to check language abilities and preferences in terms of the gender and background of therapists
Keep people engaged when they are on waiting lists through telephone or letter contact
Offer as much choice as possible in terms of the time and place of appointments
Have a transparent and accessible process for receiving and making use of feedback from
BAME service users
The importance of GPs and other referrers
There is evidence suggesting that some referrers are less likely to refer BAME patients for psychological therapy (Beck 2005). Khan et al. (2019) have suggested that GPs are less likely to refer BAME service users for psychological therapies because of difficulties in communication,
cultural differences in the way that mental health symptoms are presented, different explanatory models for distress being held by GPs and service users, cultural stereotypes that might lead to misdiagnosis, or beliefs that different treatment options may be preferred.
