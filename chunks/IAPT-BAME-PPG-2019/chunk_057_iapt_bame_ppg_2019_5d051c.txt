IAPT services can also offer training opportunities to these former service users or members of the local BAME community who are involved in related work. In the long term, this is also likely to help develop the BAME workforce. Supporting continual improvement through feedback from BAME service users
Services will benefit from a culture of continued improvement by accessing and acting on feedback from service users of all backgrounds. Even where it is collected, service user feedback is often under-utilized or not used at all, and there are considerable organizational challenges to making best use of this valuable information (Flott et al. 2017). As the IAPT Manual (2018) is clear that the Patient Experience Questionnaire should be used to collect information on service user satisfaction with services, this should be issued in the first instance. All service users should also be aware of the NHS complaints system. It may be particularly difficult for BAME service users to give feedback because of language barriers, a lack of familiarity with the NHS feedback and complaint systems, or cultural differences relating to whether it is acceptable to complain to those seen to be in positions of authority. Services committed to quality improvement may need to take additional steps to ensure that the views of BAME service users are heard and that these views are used as a basis for change. 35
