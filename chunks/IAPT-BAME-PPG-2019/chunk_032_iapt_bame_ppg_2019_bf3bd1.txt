GPs and mental health services may be approached for help once these avenues have been explored. Typically, service users do not disclose the use of community healers to therapists. This may be due to worries about being negatively judged or misunderstood for using these approaches. Once a relationship based on trust and regard has been established, it is legitimate to ask about this topic. Service users can be reassured that the therapist is respectful about their choices and understands that this is a legitimate practice within their community. Community-specific approaches can be therapy-enhancing, neutral or therapy-interfering, and it can take a degree of expertise to determine which of these is the case. Community-based interventions may be financially, emotionally or physically abusive, although this only applies to a minority of cases. The usual safeguarding procedures should be followed where this is suspected. Therapists may not be familiar with practices discussed by service users. Where this is the case,
it is reasonable to seek information from service users themselves, from interpreters and from chaplaincy services, or to ask professional colleagues who are from that community for cultural advice about a particular practice. Cashwell (2018) provides a useful framework for thinking about these issues in supervision, and this forum is likely to be a useful place for therapists to consider when they need to alert adult or child safeguarding teams, as well as understand the way that therapy may need to be adapted following religiously or spiritually framed abuse. 21
