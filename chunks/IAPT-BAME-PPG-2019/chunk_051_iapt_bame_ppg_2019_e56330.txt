Often, in services, the expertise needed for working with diversity and across cultures is assumed to be held by staff from BAME backgrounds. Making BAME staff the leads on diversity issues also means that they are less likely to be able to take on leadership roles around other issues of service development or therapy specialties, thus restricting their career development in other areas. Lastly,
this can signal to other members of staff that diversity issues are not a priority for them. Care should be taken to ensure that services do more than just nominate diversity champions;
responsibility for working in a culturally responsive and effective way should be held by everyone in the team if it is to be effective. A team which prioritizes cross-cultural thinking and community engagement will find itself managing more referrals, as more people from BAME communities will choose to engage in therapy and achieve better outcomes. 32
