IAPT-BAME-PPG-2019
The ROSHNI-2 study focuses on improving engagement with the family, self-esteem, social support and independent coping strategies. The emphasis is on keeping the programme culturally appropriate. This includes a family-centred recruitment pathway, ensuring that all study assessments and the delivery of the programme is available in the key South Asian languages (Urdu, Bengali, Gujarati, Punjabi, Hindi and Tamil), while also using stories to help service users understand situations and apply the principles of CBT, incorporate religious/
spiritual activities; further, the provision of childcare and transport is also important. Given the concerns about blame, labelling and stigma, the women expressed a preference for the programme to be called the Positive Health Programme (PHP). A major adaptation is an engagement protocol for mothers, fathers and extended family. To address stigma concerns,
it is framed as an educational programme for building problem-solving and additional life skills, and people who attend are given certificates at the end of the intervention. The PHP involves 12 weekly sessions facilitated by a trained research therapist who leads the group. Regular supervision is provided by a senior CBT therapist and a senior psychiatrist. The sessions last approximately 60-90 minutes and involve group discussions, case scenarios,
individual goal-setting and skills-based activities. The programme has been designed to be simple and pragmatic and can be delivered by an individual trained in basic mental health and CBT principles. 13
