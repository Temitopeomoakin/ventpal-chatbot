Given the increasing importance of self-referral and the likely increase in this regard following community engagement events, it will also be helpful if people who self-refer are given accurate information about what will be likely to happen next in terms of timelines, the frequency and duration of therapy, and expectations in terms of attendance and collaboration. This information could include an overview of what therapies are available, how confidentiality works in the service,
whether there is a choice in terms of the gender and ethnicity of their therapist (and in which service locations this choice will be available), and whether interpreters are available. General leaflets for the service should also include photographs of people from a range of ethnicities,
genders, ages and backgrounds to ensure that there is genuine equality in communication about whom the service is there to help. Where this is the case it might be helpful to have these checked by a group with expertise in the culture and language group the leaflet is designed for. Ideally these people would also have some expertise in mental health. Where regular face-to-face contact or co-location between referrers and IAPT services is not possible, good working relationships should be facilitated by telephone contact and discussions about referrals. NHS England has developed useful standards regarding making information accessible to service users, including the consideration of disabilities as well as literacy and language needs (NHSE
2017) (NHSE Accessible Information Standards 2017). 10
