There may be differences in the degree to which communities are accessible to IAPT services. Some communities have very visible and active representative groups, while others, especially more marginalized and newly arrived groups, are less likely to have community leads who are readily amenable to joint work with mental health services. Further examples of how this work can be done can be found in Beck and Naz (2019), who specifically look at engagement work with South Asian communities. Creative ways of working with BAME communities to improve access
Drama
The BAME Working Group at the Pennine Care Healthy Minds service performed an awardwinning play in Urdu and English for various audiences including BAME and white workingclass communities. The aim of the play was to initiate a dialogue with communities in the
Borough of Rochdale about depression, the impact it can have on peopleâ€™s lives and how their local IAPT service could help. The play itself was about a young Muslim man who returned from university to live with his family once more after the death of his father. The play touched on sensitive issues of loss, the impact on the family network, suicidal ideation and drug use in a way that was acceptable to local communities because the play had been developed by people from those same communities. The play was well received and improved access rates of BAME communities in that particular service. 30
