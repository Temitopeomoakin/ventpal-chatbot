SECTION 4: WORKFORCE AND STAFFING
Service-wide values to support work with BAME communities
Cross cultural work needs to be supported by a values-led culture in services. Dâ€™Ardenne et al. (2011) have outlined what these values might look like within a team, these are summarized below. Key values to support effective work across cultures
A staff team that is itself diverse
A staff team that works to develop knowledge about the local communities it serves
A staff team that has a curiosity about and respect for the cultures it serves
A staff team that acknowledges the value of non-Western approaches to understanding mental health problems
A staff team that prioritizes thinking about diversity in staff meetings
A staff team that values reflective practice around working with diverse communities
A system that checks the preferred language of the assessment before this takes place
A staff team that values the role of interpreters and works to support them in their roles
A team that ensures that service user preferences for the gender and ethnicity of their therapist is taken into account wherever possible
A team which places a high value on respect for and curiosity about all new cultures
Support for these values should come from senior members of staff, including managers and supervisors; however, the values should be embraced by all members of staff. Teams with a strong shared ethos and vision are likely to be more effective. Recruitment of new staff should include ensuring that they have a demonstrable commitment to working with equality and diversity. Existing staff should be supported to access training around working with diversity, while job plans should include some degree of community outreach for most team members. These initiatives will support staff from all backgrounds in developing confidence and competence in working flexibly with evidence-based therapy models in order to adapt them to the specific needs of the communities served.
