This increase in session length is clearly supported by the IAPT Manual (National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health 2018). Where there are constraints regarding the length of time available, services should consider making it possible to offer additional sessions. It is also possible that extended therapy sessions are demanding for the service user, interpreter and therapist. It might be useful to take a break after 50 minutes, as fatigue is likely to have a negative impact on the therapeutic process. Where the therapist and interpreter are planning to meet after the appointment, the service user should be told about this. The rationale for this should be explained to them. An example explanation is provided below. ‘After our appointment has finished your interpreter and myself will meet for a few minutes. This is to give us a chance to check with one another about how our work together has gone. ‘We will ask the advice of one another regarding how we can work more effectively as a team next time. Is there anything you would like us to think about when we do this?’
