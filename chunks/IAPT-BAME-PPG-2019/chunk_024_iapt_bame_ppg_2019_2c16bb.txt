Summary of principles of working with refugees and asylum seekers
This group has higher rates of PTSD and other mental health problems compared to the general population
This group also has higher rates of psychosis and dissociative symptoms
This group may be struggling with ongoing trauma, due to racism, marginalization and uncertainty about the safety of family members and their own refugee status in England
Some refugees and asylum seekers may not want to discuss past trauma, but can still be helped by therapy approaches that focus on improving their current situation
Refugees and asylum seekers may have experienced multiple losses and traumas before arriving in England
Refugees and asylum seekers may benefit from referral to projects that support the development of practical and language skills, as well as social opportunities to overcome their isolation
Therapists may need to do more multi-agency work to support refugees and asylum seekers including working with their legal teams
Therapists might find hearing about traumatic experiences difficult and can experience vicarious trauma
Good supervision is essential in ensuring that the therapist is working as well as they can with people who are struggling with complicated and ongoing difficulties
Working with interpreters
The need for interpreters within health settings is widely recognized as an important resource to ensure equality of access. Some BAME service users may not have sufficient language skills to make best use of therapies and other services. There are unique challenges in providing therapy through interpreters, and it is important that services have robust and considered approaches in this regard. Summary of useful principles when working with interpreters
That interpreters and service users are clear about the role of the interpreter in the session
â€“ this can be done by beginning the session with an explanation of the purpose of the appointment and the role that the interpreter will have
That confidentiality is explained to the service user by emphasizing that this will be respected by the interpreter as well
That service users are given the opportunity to request a different interpreter
That where possible the same interpreter is used throughout therapy
That the therapist checks that the interpreter is from a linguistic and ethnic group that is acceptable to the service user (for example, in case they are from an ethnic group that has been in recent conflict with the ethnic group of the service user)
That the gender of the interpreter is acceptable to the service user and a choice given regarding this, where possible
