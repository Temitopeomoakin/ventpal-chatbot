IAPT-BAME-PPG-2019
There is compelling evidence that service user outcomes are improved across the board when services genuinely commit to and invest in equality within their staff teams. Managers should review access to further training and CPD. This should include access to supervision and leadership training to prepare people for senior positions. Where this access is clearly unequal, it may be necessary to specifically work to increase the training opportunities for the BAME workforce. These initiatives could include coaching and mentoring programmes within wider organizations or supporting access to courses on leadership and service development programmes. It might be necessary for teams to develop community specific training posts to diversify the workforce and provide opportunities for BAME staff to achieve career progression. These targeted posts are generally acceptable under current employment legislation and can help overcome initial barriers around entering the IAPT workforce, which some BAME candidates face. Where areas serve diverse populations, interview panels should include at least one BAME staff member and a service user from one of the BAME communities in the locality. Service users should be paid for their time when contributing to these panels. This additional support should also include careful consideration of the increased likelihood that
BAME staff will experience bullying at work (Kline 2015), some of which could be the result of direct discrimination. There is also an increased likelihood that BAME IAPT staff will experience racist responses from services users, and there is a growing recognition of the need for services to respond robustly to this (Nagpaul 2018). 34
