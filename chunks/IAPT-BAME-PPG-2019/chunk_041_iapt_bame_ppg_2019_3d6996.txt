Supervisors also need to be aware of the understandable tendency in all of us to avoid topics that make us uncomfortable or anxious. Therapists who are new to cross-cultural work might be reluctant to introduce topics concerned with ethnicity and diversity during supervision in case they get things wrong and are perceived as culturally insensitivity or even racist. This is less likely to happen in teams where there is a culture of diversity that is valued and where staff are used to supporting one another in discussions about the challenges this work can bring. These reflections can be facilitated by viewing recordings of therapy in supervision. This is a key part of the supervisory process in most IAPT training courses and services.
Supervisors might benefit from accessing a peer discussion group about supervising across cultures, using their own supervision to reflect on these issues, or attending specific training workshops about supervising across cultures. Supervising cross-cultural therapy is considered in further depth in Patel (2004) and specifically relating to CBT in Beck (2016, Chapter 10).
Summary of good practice in supervision
Supervisors do not need to be experts in cross-cultural CBT to provide good enough supervision in this area
Core supervisory skills in Socratic Dialogues, supportive challenges and shared curiosity can help therapists improve practice
Supervisors can prompt discussions about ethnicity and culture where these are not prioritized by the therapist
A good supervisory relationship will facilitate discussions that may at first seem risky or difficult
