In particular, local policy will need to be explicit about arrangements to secure consent to share information with GPs and other bodies, such as solicitors, the Department of Work and Pensions, housing agencies and the local authority. This will need to be consistently applied and explained to all IAPT service users. Although there is limited research on gender issues and engagement with mental health services amongst BAME communities, anecdotally, there is a suggestion that men in some communities are less likely to access mental health support than women (Project Focus Group 2019), particularly if they are working long hours in low-paid jobs. This is likely to be further exacerbated if people are working in sectors where there is no provision for time off work to attend appointments. Where gender-specific BAME projects have been developed, these have tended to focus on meeting the needs of women. Thus, it might be important for specific consideration to be given to the mental health needs of men in these communities too. However, services should continue to take account of needs relating specifically to sexual violence, abuse and exploitation where these particularly affect women, including some from BAME communities such as refugees and asylum seekers. Some people from BAME backgrounds may be more likely to attend their first appointment if services are based in local and accessible community facilities, such as places of worship,
neighbourhood community centres and the premises of targeted projects. 8
