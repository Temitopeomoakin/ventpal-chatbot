Where therapists believe that a lengthy response from a service user has been summarized in such a way that some of the meaning is at risk of being lost, it can be helpful to ask the interpreter to repeat their exact response in order to check for this. Therapists should ensure that their questions and statements are kept brief and clear in order to aid interpretation i.e., about specific processes (such as ‘How is your sleep?’, ‘How much time per day do you spend worrying about the future?’), rather than ‘How long have you been depressed?’. The Code of Professional Practice recognizes that interpreters may sometimes need to clarify missed cultural references or inferences which may be important in understanding what is said. An example of how interpreters and service users can be prepared for the session is given below. The space between the paragraphs is there to indicate where the therapist might pause to allow interpretation to take place. ‘Hello my name is Mille, I am the therapist you will be working with in the service. This is Layla. She is an interpreter who works with our service. Both of us will respect your confidentiality whilst you are working with us here. What this means is that anything you say to us remains private and will not be discussed with others without your permission. 18
