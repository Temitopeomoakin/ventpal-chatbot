‘Do you have any questions about how that will work? ‘I will keep a record of our appointments and will write to your GP to let them know we have met. ‘I will always check that you are happy with me sharing any other information with other organizations. ‘The interpreter and I will not share information about what we have talked about today with people we know. ‘We will not share information with other organizations that you want to keep confidential or private. ‘The exception to this is if I am worried about your safety or the safety of others. Then I might need to talk to other people to make sure that you and other people are kept safe. I will let you know if I am going to do this and try to agree the safest and most helpful way to go about it. ‘The interpreter is not here to give you advice or to help with your problem. Their job is to translate what I say, so that you can understand it, and then to translate what you say, so that I can understand you. ‘Do you have any questions about this? ‘Are you happy with this way of working together? ‘If you would like a different interpreter, you are very welcome to request one. We will do our best to find someone else with the right language skills and background. If it is easier you can let me know outside of this appointment if that is the case. Otherwise, we will try to keep the same interpreter whilst we are working together.’
It is particularly important that service managers appreciate the need for longer sessions when interpreters are being used and that job plans are modified accordingly. Typically, the session can be 50-100% longer when interpreters are being used.
