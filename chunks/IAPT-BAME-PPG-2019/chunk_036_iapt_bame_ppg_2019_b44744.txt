Working within disorder-specific treatment protocols
One of the cornerstones of much of the training and service provision in IAPT has been the development of evidence-based, disorder-specific treatments, which are in line with NICE guidance. These models of treatment are based on the identification of mental health problems in largely white communities in Europe and North America. In recent years, research has begun to look at the degree to which these ways of identifying mental health problems and the treatment approaches used are meaningful in BAME communities in
Europe and North America and in populations outside of these geographical areas. Therapists should be prepared to use a flexible approach when using treatment protocols in working across cultures and to have realistic expectations regarding the possible limits of applying mental health models developed for one culture to another. The service user and therapist should work collaboratively to find out what aspects of the model are helpful for the service user at that time. Therapists will be familiar with the Kolb learning cycle (Kolb 1983), which can be a useful framework to share with service users whilst collaboratively understanding what aspects of disorder-specific treatments are helpful. 23
