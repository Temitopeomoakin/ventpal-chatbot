Asking service users about their ethnic and religious background
The ethnicity of service users should be recorded in 100% of cases for administrative and service evaluation purposes. It is the responsibility of the clinical commissioning group (CCG) to ensure that this information is collected, recorded and submitted as part of the national reporting process in line with the Equalities Act (2010). Asking about the background of service users also plays an important role in developing the therapeutic alliance and supporting better therapy outcomes. There is some evidence that therapists are reluctant to ask about the ethnic background of service users in case such questioning impacts negatively on the therapeutic relationship by, for example,
suggesting that the therapist is racist or culturally insensitive (Dogra et al. 2007). Therapeutic effectiveness can, in fact, be enhanced when this question is asked for several reasons, as doing so:
• is likely to have a positive effect on the therapeutic relationship by communicating a respectful interest in the background of the service user
• can provide a useful starting point for further discussions about background, family organization, migration histories and spirituality or religion
• provides an opportunity for therapists to acknowledge ethnic differences or similarities between themselves and the service user
Once discussions have begun about ethnicity, faith and culture, these can be elaborated as therapy progresses to develop a richer understanding of the degree to which culturally specific beliefs, practices and family processes could play a part in the presenting problem, or be assets and strengths that support recovery. Supervision is a good forum for therapists to think about how they can improve the way these factors are incorporated into therapy. Therapists can explain to service users that they are being asked about their ethnic background because it is important for the service to know the ethnicity of who attends in order to ensure that members of all communities in the area are able to access mental health care.
