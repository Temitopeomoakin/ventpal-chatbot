While initial evaluations at
IAPT sites suggested a lower uptake by BAME communities once people were engaged outcomes could be as good as those for white majority service users (Clark et al. 2009). This Positive Practice Guide updates the principles of the 2009 guide and provides a framework for
IAPT service managers, supervisors and clinicians to work towards better access and outcomes. The guidance draws on the current body of evidence around which factors determine equitable access and therapy outcomes for BAME communities in mental health settings. Recent data from IAPT (Clark et al. 2018) indicates that clinical outcomes for service users living in socioeconomically deprived areas can be as good as those in more affluent areas if services are appropriately funded and deliver therapy in line with IAPT quality standards. We believe that adopting these principles will likewise improve access and outcomes for BAME service users while, at the same time, support better staff retention and job satisfaction and contribute to the development of an engaged and motivated workforce. 6
