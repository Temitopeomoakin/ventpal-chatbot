Managing_Your_Worries
When breaking down a difficulty with finance, think about the different components such as how much debt you have, what your income and what your expenditure is. Sometimes with problems such as this, itâ€™s also worth thinking if there are others with specialist knowledge who can help. For example, professionals with this specific type of knowledge or organisations and charities in the community that may be able to help. If you find yourself struggling with breaking your problems down then speak to the person supporting you who may be able to help. 40 41
