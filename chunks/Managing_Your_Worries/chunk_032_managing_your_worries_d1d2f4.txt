Managing_Your_Worries
IMPORTANT
When trying to identify a practical solution to our worries it’s really important to make sure the solution doesn’t involve using some of those worry behaviours. For example reassurance seeking, over-preparing, over-planning, repeatedly checking,
putting important things off, distracting yourself from your worries – we spoke about earlier in the workbook. Using these behaviours to try and solve your worries won’t help you learn to live with uncertainty and help you get out of the vicious cycle of worry in the long-term. Remember to ask yourself “Is my solution a long-term solution to my worry?” You may find worry behaviours are short-term solutions, but they won’t help solve and overcome your worries in the longer-term. 34 35
