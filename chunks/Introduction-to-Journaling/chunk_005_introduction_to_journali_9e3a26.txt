Introduction-to-Journaling
Try to just start without worrying about where it will go and see what happens. Once you have finished writing step away for a while and do something else. Come back to what you have written after a couple of hours, read it through, and see what you think. Would you like to try taking this further? Prompts
We have created several small handouts with a selection of prompts designed to help you find ideas about what you might write. Feel free to download and try them out if you are ever struggling to get started with your writing.
