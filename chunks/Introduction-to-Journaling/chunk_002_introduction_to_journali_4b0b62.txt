Introduction to Journaling
Important Note:
Grammar, spelling, style of writing etc. is not important for your own personal journaling; there is no “correct” way to do this. Focussing on spelling etc. can stop the flow of writing. It’s more important to get words on the page. There is no “correct” way to draw/make art etc. You don’t need to have experience or consider yourself to have artistic skills. The Benefits of Writing
“Across multiple studies, people who engage in expressive writing report feeling happier and less negative than they felt before writing. Similarly,
reports of depressive symptoms, rumination, and general anxiety tend to drop in the weeks and months after writing about emotional upheavals
(Lepore 1997). Other studies found improvement in overall well-being and improved cognitive functioning (Barclay & Skarlicki 2009).”
From Expressive Writing: Words That Heal by James W Pennebaker and John F Evans
