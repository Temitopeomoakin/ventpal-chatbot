Introduction-to-Journaling
What you decide to write or draw in your journal is completely up to you. You may want to sit down at the end of every day and record everything that happened to you that day. On the other hand, you may only want to make a note of things you feel are particularly important. Some people use their journals to help them rethink past experiences, while others look to the future. If you are thinking of keeping a journal to help improve your mental health a good place to start is to use your journal to help you monitor your moods. This can be done as simply as making a daily note of your mood using a scale of 1 to 5, or A to G, or whatever you think would work for you. You might then also record a few details of anything that happened that might have had an impact on your mood, whether for better or worse. What Does a Journal Look Like? A journal is, of course, a very personal thing – not just its contents, but also its object itself. Do you want to keep your journal in a special book with an attractive cover and good quality paper? Or perhaps you would prefer a ringbinder and loose sheets of paper? Maybe you would rather use an app on your phone or computer? Whatever you choose it is important that it feels right for you and makes it as easy as possible for you to access and to record your thoughts. Give something a try, but if it doesn’t feel right don’t be afraid to try something else. Introduction to Journaling
