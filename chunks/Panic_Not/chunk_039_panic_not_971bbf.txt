Checking-in with How I’m Doing
As you finish this workbook it can be helpful to find a regular time to check-in and see how you’re doing. If you think having a weekly check-in would be helpful, complete the worksheet and use it over the coming weeks or months.
MY CHECKING-IN WORKSHEET
I will check-in with myself about the emotion that has been troubling me every
....................................... over the next ..................................... weeks.
Since starting this workbook:
Yes No
Am I experiencing physical sensations again and getting distressed by them?
Am I having those terrible thoughts again about my physical sensations?
Have I started doing more or less of those unhelpful behaviours?
Am I struggling with my emotions again?
If I think my difficulties are returning again, what sorts of things could I do to help me overcome them again?
Remember: We discussed earlier how experiencing a range of physical sensations is perfectly normal if you experience them for a short time. They can be helpful, keeping us safe from things in the environment that may be of danger.
