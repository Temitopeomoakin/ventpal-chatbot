Panic Not: Managing Panic Disorder
WELCOME!
First of all, well done for seeking help to get on top of your panic!
The ‘Panic Not’ workbook is based on an evidence-based psychological therapy called Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT).
CBT for ‘panic’ focuses on the here-and-now and helps people who have sudden, unexpected episodes of fear about bodily sensations they are experiencing to understand the problem and change things that keep the distressing bodily sensations going.
The workbook will guide you through a technique called
Challenging Thoughts and Testing Them Out shown to help many people having these sudden feelings of panic or panic attacks.
It’s designed to be worked through with the support of a mental health professional trained to ensure people make the most of the technique. Across England this will often be a Psychological
Wellbeing Practitioner, working within an Improving Access to
Psychological Therapies service. Given the success of this way of working, similar roles have now also become available in other countries.
You may have also come across this workbook on your own. Whether with support or using on your own, you’re in control of the way you choose to work through the workbook.
