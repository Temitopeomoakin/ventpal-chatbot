Panic Not: Managing Panic Disorder
ZAHARA’S TESTING MY TERRIBLE
THOUGHT WORKSHEET
Thought to be Put into Action
The thought I want to put into action is: I believe this thought (0–100%)
“My panic sensations may be very uncomfortable and
50%
distressing, but they are not harmful.”
Designing the Experiment
I am going to test this thought by:
Use the exercise bike for 20 minutes.
What?
At home.
Where?
Saturday morning
When?
On my own, although Dan and Ellana will be in the house.
Who?
Predicting the Worst
I predict the worst that will happen is: I think this will happen (0–100%)
The exercise will put too much strain on my heart and I’ll
60%
have a heart attack.
Predicting an Alternative I think this will happen (0–100%)
My heart rate will go really high and I’ll feel
30%
uncomfortable, but nothing bad will happen to my heart..
Barriers and Overcoming Them
The following things may get in the way:
Internal:
External: Dan might need help with Ellana and that will take priority
I might overcome any problems by:
Make sure Ellana is fine before I start and maybe ask Dan to take her out so they don’t distract me.
