ZAHARA’S TESTING MY TERRIBLE THOUGHT
REVIEW WORKSHEET
Thought to be Put into Action
The thought I want to put into action is: I believe this thought (0–100%)
“My panic sensations may be very uncomfortable and
50%
distressing, but they are not harmful.”
My Original Prediction
I predicted the following would happen: I believe this thought (0–100%)
The exercise will put too much strain on my heart and I’ll
60%
have a heart attack. The Results
What actually happened was:
My heart was really beating fast throughout the experiment. I felt very panicky at one point, but nothing bad happened and I didn’t have a heart attack. After the experiment finished my heart rate returned to normal and I was fine. My Learning
From this Behavioural Experiment I have learned:
Just because my heart rate goes up, it doesn’t mean I’m in danger of having a heart attack. Loads of people do exercise and nothing happens to their heart. The doctors have told me there is nothing wrong with my heart and this experiment supports that. Revising My Original Thought
I would now change my original thought to:
When I experience sensations of anxiety/panic, they are not a sign that anything is wrong with me and aren’t going to result in a heart attack. I believe this new thought (0-100%) 85% I believe my original thought (0-100%) 10%
Changing Behaviour
Based on my new thought I’m going to do the following differently:
I’m going to try and do more with Ellana, as well as get back into the gym, seeing my friends and living my life again basically! Next Steps
Other Activities I may want to get back to doing again
To do some exercise outside of my home. To meet up with my friends in a bar or restaurant.
