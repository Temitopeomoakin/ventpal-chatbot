STEP 3: TESTING THOUGHTS OUT
Although we may be able to create a Revised, More Balanced Thought, sometimes it may be difficult to fully believe it due to a difference between what we logically know to be true and what we feel in our hearts. There are three stages to test thoughts and strengthen our belief in them:
Stage 1
Plan a way to test your revised terrible thought
Stage 2 Stage 3
Do – carry out Review your plan and test
Keeping your healthcare professional informed of the treatment you’re receiving is important to ensure you receive the best care. You may have already spoken to them to ensure there isn’t an underlying physical cause for the physical sensations you’ve been having. They may have given you some reassurance this is the case. If you haven’t however,
consider if you feel it would be helpful to get in touch to check whether any additional investigations are needed.
