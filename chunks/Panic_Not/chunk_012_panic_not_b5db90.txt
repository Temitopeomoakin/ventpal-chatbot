Before you start using Thought Challenging, you may find it helpful to set yourself goals you’d like to achieve by the time you complete the workbook.
When setting goals it’s important to think about the following:
Specific Realistic
Be Be
It can be tempting to set general Set yourself goals you think goals such as “To manage better”. you can achieve over the next
However, it will be hard to know few weeks. Therefore, think about when you’ve achieved this goal. setting yourself Short Term Goals,
Instead, think about how you just out of reach, but not out of would know if you were managing sight. Then begin working towards better. For example, “Take Ellana these and move on to Medium for a 20 minute walk in her pram at and then Long Term goals. It’s least once a day”. important to think about Medium and Long Term goals too as they give you something to work towards when you achieve those in the shorter term.
Positive
Be
It can be tempting to set goals in terms of doing less or stopping something.
For example, “I will stop being so distressed when my heart begins to race”.
However, it’s more helpful to set goals in a positive way, as striving towards something. The above could be changed to “I will continue to walk with
Dan and Ellana even when my heart begins to race”.
Remember: It’s often perfectly normal to experience those unwanted physical sensations discussed earlier. So, avoid setting goals to never have them, remember at times they may be helpful.
