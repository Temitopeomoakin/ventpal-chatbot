Panic Not: Managing Panic Disorder
STEP 2: THOUGHT CHALLENGING
When we experience terrible thoughts, it can be very difficult to tell they’re just thoughts, and not facts. This is because those terrible thoughts can feel very powerful and believable. Challenging your thoughts by examining evidence for and against them can help. Here’s how to do it:
n Choose a Terrible Thought from your PANIC DIARY WORKSHEET that causes you the most distress and has the strongest link to the emotion you’ve identified. This is your
Terrible Thought. n Where possible, it’s helpful to work on a thought with at least 60% belief and panic with at least 60% intensity. n Write your Terrible Thought at the top of your THOUGHT CHALLENGING WORKSHEET with the rating for belief in this thought. n Next put your Terrible Thought on trial, by gathering evidence for and against it. Do this by listing all the evidence in both columns. n It’s important the evidence you record is based on ‘fact’ rather than ‘opinion’. Asking yourself the following questions can help you identify evidence based on facts. What would I say What evidence to a friend who had would my friends this thought in a or family give me similar situation? against this thought? If I rate the belief in
If I wasn’t feeling my terrible thought as this way, would 85%, then there is 15%
I believe this? of the thought I don’t
If not, why? believe to be true. What makes up that 15%? It’s likely you’ve believed your terrible thought for a while and therefore it’s common to find it difficult to challenge at first. However, like all new skills, it will become easier with time. REMEMBER: If you find yourself struggling with this, raise it with any person that may be supporting you.
